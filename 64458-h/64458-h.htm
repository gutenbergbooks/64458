</div>


<p>It had been a hot day, and the minister had brought
us, my mother and myself, from the city to his country
home, in a mysterious, antediluvian species of buggy.
Of all the race of men it is the country minister alone
who can discover this particular breed of buggy. They
are always gifted with strange powers of endurance;
never being purchased until they have seemingly reached
the point of dissolution, they will thereafter, for years
and years, shake and totter, and rattle and rock, carrying
all the time not only people but almost every
conceivable kind of merchandise, from a few pounds of
groceries to a pumpkin or a very youthful calf, without
coming one step nearer their final wreck.</p>

<p>This special buggy could hold one person in comfort,
two in discomfort and three in torture. I had
been the party of the <i>third</i> part in that day&#8217;s ride, and
worn out and crumpled and dusty, we passed from
darkness into a room full of lamplight and faces. I
was trying to support myself steadily upon a pair of
legs so recently aroused from dumb sleep that they
had barely reached the ticklish stage, and the ten thousand
needle-prickling power was in full blast when the
Rev. Hyler introduced me to his seven sons. My dazzled
eyes and tired mind made them seem full seventeen
to me, and they were so big and rough and noisy,
I hung my head, confused, disappointed, frightened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
even, and then I felt the gentle pressure of her hot little
hand on mine.</p>

<p>I raised my childish eyes and saw the sweetness of
the smile upon her pallid face, saw it dawn upon her
lips, pass swiftly to the dimple in her cheek, hide a
moment there, only to reappear the next dancing in the
sapphire blueness of her eyes&mdash;saw and mentally
bowed down and worshipped her from that moment.
Physically, I clung close to her burning hand and gave
her back a smile of such astounding breadth and frankness
as must have revealed to her my entire dental
economy; and when, a few minutes later, I learned that
she whispered because her voice was gone&mdash;lost forever,
I felt such a passion of love and pity for her, such a
longing to spare her suffering, that, but for its absurdity,
I could have wounded my own flesh that I might
bear the pain in her name. Grown-ups do not always
understand the strength of feeling young things are
capable of.</p>

<p>Next day we two round pegs began fitting ourselves
into the new holes prepared for us, and though they
were not absolutely square, they were still far enough
from roundness to be very uncomfortable holes indeed.
My mother began her never-ending duties of housekeeper.
Mrs. Hyler had broken down from overwork
and sick-nursing, and I having, as my mother once
declared, &#8220;as many eyes as had a peacock&#8217;s tail,&#8221; began
my almost unconscious observations of a new form of
poverty. (I already had a really exhaustive knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of the subject both from observation and from personal
experience, and I had come to the conclusion that the
bitterness of poverty was greatly influenced by the manner
in which it was accepted. I had known abject,
ragged poverty to enjoy streaks of real merriment on
comparatively comfortable occasions, while higher up
in life those who openly acknowledged their poverty
seemed only to suffer its inconvenience and to know
nothing of the shame and humiliation of those who
tried to hide theirs by agonizing makeshifts.) Here
I found it was accepted in sullen silence, but, nevertheless,
bitter resentment lowered on every face save
my dear Miss Linda&#8217;s.</p>

<p>She always turned to those eighteen watchful, loving
eyes a sweetly-smiling, pallid face with serene brows;
but I saw her sometimes when smile and serenity were
both gone and her face was anguished.</p>

<p>The Rev. Hyler, minister, farmer, father of seven
sons, was himself a seventh son, and had he been examined
at his birth with that closeness of scrutiny given
to first-born babies, I&#8217;m positive the word &#8220;failure&#8221;
could have been found plainly stamped upon his small
person. He was a tall, gray, narrow man, and seemed
always to have a bitter taste in his mouth. Black-coated,
white-tied and pale, he seemed to have been
pressed between the leaves of some old volume of sermons
and left there till all the color and sap had dried
out of him as it might dry out of a pressed violet or
pansy. Perpetual ill-humor had stamped to the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
bone the three-lined frown he wore between his eyebrows.
He was an educated man and full of information&mdash;that
was of no use to him. He could give statistics
as to the number of the inhabitants of Palestine,
but he could not tell whether an unsatisfactory field
required topdressing or under-draining. He had been
an instructor, a teacher; had, in fact, been at the head
of one of the State colleges, but failed and came
back, much embittered, to the small church he had left
with such high hopes; but finding he had provided
himself with more mouths than his salary could
well fill he had taken to farming, at which he seemed
to be the greatest failure of all.</p>

<p>Narrow and cold by nature, soured by disappointment,
he loved but one person on earth, and that person
was his first-born child, his only daughter, Linda.
He admired her, he was proud of her, he loved her,
truly and tenderly, beyond a doubt; but, alas, as surely
beyond a doubt, his was a jealous and a selfish love, and
she, with eyes whose power and penetration fully
equalled their rare beauty of coloring, read him
through and through, as she might have read a book!
Saw the dry, gray man&#8217;s weakness of resolve, his bitter
temper, his small tyrannies, and worse&mdash;far worse,
because that was a most repellant sin&mdash;his hypocrisy; saw
all these things and with no touch of sympathy for any
one of them, but, with what seemed almost divine compassion,
she gave him reverent service and such tender,
loyal love as many a better father fails all his life to win.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>And this sweet Linda, woman-grown&mdash;this young
lady who had &#8220;come out,&#8221; and had had a season of
social gaiety in the city&mdash;who&mdash;oh, wondrous being!
had had real &#8220;for true&#8221; lovers&mdash;she stooped from her
high estate to honor me with her attention, her conversation&mdash;even,
to a certain point, her confidence&mdash;while
I had only reached that humiliating stage in life where
old ladies could refer to me as a &#8220;growing-girl.&#8221; And
this condescension filled me with such joy&mdash;such stupendous
pride&mdash;I marvel it did not precede a mighty
fall. But, looking back upon it all, I think I see a
pathetic reason for that unequal companionship. My
mother, knowing me to be painfully sensitive to suffering
or sorrow, kept from me the knowledge that the
girl I so loved was slowly dying, a victim of that fell
disease, consumption! Her days were so surely numbered
that no one had the faintest hope that she would
see the yellowing of the leaves that now danced greenly
on the trees. I saw her pale and very, very fragile,
and only loved her more. I saw her faint sometimes,
but I had seen other women faint when I knew they
were not ill, and, to my childish ideas, anyone who
rose from her bed and dressed each day must surely
be quite well. So it came about that in my eyes alone
she belonged still to the world of the living&mdash;in my
face alone could she read love without anxiety, and
when she laughed, as she often did, it was only in my
eye she found a hearty, gay response, for every other
glance was full of anguished pity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>If my ignorance was not bliss, it was, at least, I truly
think, a comfort to her, since by its help she could forget
for a time, at least, that she was doomed and set
aside as having nothing more to do with life. And my
profound interest and <i>na&iuml;f</i> admiration egged her on to
tell me of the gay, sweet past&mdash;such an innocent, pitifully
short past it was&mdash;of her small triumphs and her
pretty frocks. Sometimes she would even show me
her few girlish trinkets, but I was quick to observe that
if I ever asked about her future use of them a sort of
shudder passed over her white face and her eyes would
close quickly for a moment; then she would answer
evasively, gently; yet there was a flatness in the tones
of her voice, and she would surely remark, &#8220;that she
would try now to doze a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long before my observation brought
me closer to her tender heart, while slowly I learned,
little by little, something of the weight of the
cross this fragile girl was bearing on her trembling
shoulders.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hyler was, I think, the most disconcerting person
in this uncomfortable family. Her manner toward
them was that of a moderately devoted housekeeper&mdash;head
nurse, who presumed slightly by reason of her
long service. The last scant drop of kindness&mdash;the
last ray of warmth of affection&mdash;I dare not use a
stronger word&mdash;was for her Linda! But we must remember
that for four and twenty years she had listened to
what the Rev. Hyler &#8220;was going to do,&#8221; and had suffered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
from what the Rev. Hyler &#8220;did not do,&#8221; and there
was no hope left in her.</p>

<p>I shall not introduce her sons individually, but will
simply state that between the Spanish-looking eldest one&mdash;brave,
loyal, honest and kind&mdash;and the impish youngest,
with the face of a blond seraph and a heart like a
nether mill-stone, there were five others, each one striving
to be&mdash;or so it seemed&mdash;as unlike his brothers as
possible. In all their lives they had found but two subjects
they could agree upon; on these, however, they
were as one boy. Their honest, hearty love for &#8220;Sister
Linda&#8221; was one subject, and a fixed determination to
&#8220;get even&#8221; with their father was the other.</p>

<p>Linda Hyler loved music profoundly, and she had
not only natural talent, but powers of concentration
and a capacity for hard work that might have made an
artist of her. And the poor child had had her opportunity&mdash;for
one with means and power and the inclination
to use them, attracted by the purity and volume
of her voice and by her earnest ambition, had offered
to assist her to that stern training, so difficult in those
days to obtain, even when one had the money to pay
for it. But if she had talent, she also had a father,
and he with the bitter taste seemingly strong in his
mouth, refused the kindly offer, giving no nobler reason
for his act than that &#8220;she was his only daughter and
he would miss her far too much.&#8221; She pleaded with
him in vain, and had the pain of seeing her one opportunity
float away from her, taking on, as it went, all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the airy grace, all the glancing beauty of a bubble
floating in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Had her father not provided so much material for
its building, the cross she bore might not have been
so heavy. Up to the time of our arrival, Linda had
managed to sit a little while each day before the battered
old organ that stood in an otherwise empty room.
To any other family it would have been the parlor&mdash;to
this family it was a thing without a name. But
even as you have seen a timid, lonely woman appear at
her window, whistling loudly and wearing a man&#8217;s hat&mdash;by
means of which she convinces would-be burglars
of the presence there of a large and very destructive
man&mdash;so these parlor windows were well curtained, that
the occasional humped-over, slow-driving passer-by
might be convinced that this parlor held&mdash;(as much
ingrain-horse-hair-worsted-crocheting, and high art
plaster cats, with round black spots and heavy coats
of varnish as any)&mdash;and I suppose that one trick was
quite as convincing as the other&mdash;any way, there
sat Linda in that dreary room, before the organ,
drawing from its sulky and unwilling interior
sounds of such solemn sweetness as made one
pray involuntarily; and sometimes she played simply
an accompaniment&mdash;sitting with lifted face and closed
eyes, the veins swelling in her throat, but no sound
coming from her moving lips. Already I had become
her second shadow, and so I&#8217;d creep into the empty
room after her, and listen to her playing, and once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
when I was greatly moved, she turned to me and said:
&#8220;Little Sister&#8221;&mdash;the pet name she had graciously
bestowed on me&mdash;&#8220;what does that make you think of?&#8221;</p>

<p>And without a pause I answered eagerly: &#8220;A
church&mdash;not,&#8221; I hurriedly explained, &#8220;not our church,
but a great one with pictures, and lots of people, and
lights and sweet-smoke!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah, how she laughed, and though it was but a husky
whispering affair, it was still a very merry laugh,
because of the light that danced so gaily to it in her eyes.
She then informed me that the music had been a mere
scrap from a famous oratorio, and that my &#8220;sweet-smoke&#8221;
was called incense, and though she set me
right, it was her harmless jest to use the word &#8220;sweet-smoke&#8221;
herself ever after.</p>

<p>We had been there but a little while, when one day
I noticed something wrong with the music; the tones
were weak and wavering, there seemed to be no certainty
in her touch. Her little hand could not hold a
simple chord with firmness, and then the next moment
there was a soft crash of the yellow, old keys, as Linda
sank forward helpless and panting. I sprang to help
her, and between two struggling, unwilling breaths, I
heard her whisper: &#8220;Must this go too? Dear God!
must this go too?&#8221;</p>

<p>By chance the little brother had been present. He
called his mother, and presently Linda was on the sofa
in the other room, and the inevitable farm-house remedy
for all mortal ills, the camphor-bottle&mdash;or to use the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
rural term, the &#8220;camfire&#8221;&mdash;had been produced, and
soon Linda raised her eyes and called up the old, sweet
smile; while little Arthur stood with sturdy legs far
apart&mdash;his hands in his small pockets, and his father&#8217;s
own special brand of frown upon his brow&mdash;watching
his sister&#8217;s restoration; then he remarked: &#8220;Linda, it
was blowin&#8217; wind into that d&mdash;blamed old organ, that
busted yer all up just now!&mdash;so it was!&mdash;and after this
yer just pull yer feet back out of the way, and I&#8217;ll
crawl under there, and work them &#8216;pedal treadle
things,&#8217; and blow yer all the wind yer want&mdash;and if I
blow so hard it busts the thing, papa darsent lick me,
&#8217;cause I&#8217;ll be doin&#8217; it for you!&#8221; and he danced with
malicious glee!</p>

<p>Next day he kept his word, and though Miss Linda
played a little while, somehow the spirit seemed to have
gone out of her music. But when Arthur came out on
all-fours from under the instrument&#8217;s front, hot, red
and tousled, his sister shook his little hand and
thanked him and kissed him tenderly&mdash;and he, swelling
with gratified pride and love, went out behind the
smoke-house, where he swore a little for practice, and
tried to kill the cat.</p>

<p>Next morning early, as I left our room, I glanced into
Miss Linda&#8217;s, and saw it had not been put in order yet.
Being ever eager to do something in her service, I
thought I might slip in and beat up her pillows and
place them in the sun as I had seen the &#8220;grown-ups&#8221;
do. So in I went and, snatching up the nearest pillow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
I gave a startled &#8220;Oh!&#8221; and stood staring, for beneath
it lay the miniature of a man, whose questioning brown
eyes looked up at me from a face young yet stern to the
point of sombreness. My first impulse was to restore
the pillow and run away, but next moment I noticed,
lying close to the picture, all crumpled up into a little
wad, Miss Linda&#8217;s handkerchief. I leaned over and
touched it, and it was still damp with tears. A great
lump rose in my throat and, though I was but a &#8220;growing-girl,&#8221;
it was the heart of a woman that was giving
those quick, hard blows in my breast and making
me understand. I sprang across the room and softly
closed the door. I said to myself: &#8220;Miss Linda loves
him, and she is unhappy and grieves, and she does not
wish them to know!&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to her bureau and took a fresh handkerchief
from the drawer, then I took the miniature&mdash;it was on
ivory, and, from its small, gold frame, I fancied it had
been intended for an ornament&mdash;and slipped it into
the velvet case I found near by; then I carefully rolled
the case inside of the handkerchief and started downstairs,
trying hard to look unconcerned as I entered the
dining-room.</p>

<p>Breakfast had just been placed upon the table, and
every one save Linda was moving toward it. A little,
drooping figure still seated, she seemed very ill that
morning, and the great, dark circles about her eyes
looked like purple stains on her white face. I
crossed directly to her, thus turning my back upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
every one else, and leaning over her and thrusting my
small package into her hand with a warning pressure
of the fingers, I said: &#8220;I have brought a fresh handkerchief
for you, Miss Linda&mdash;do you want it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment she touched the parcel she understood.
Her eyes sent one startled glance toward her father&mdash;then
she looked at me. The white weariness faded all
away, and warmly, rosily I saw her love blossom
sweetly in her face, while she answered: &#8220;Thank you,
little sister&mdash;yes I want it,&#8221; and slipped the handkerchief
into the pocket of her gown, just as her father
pushed me impatiently aside that he might assist her
to her place at table.</p>

<p>He instantly noted the color in her face and sharply
exclaimed: &#8220;What&#8217;s this&mdash;what&#8217;s this! is this a feverish
manifestation, at this hour of the day?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Linda smiled and charged him with &#8220;cultivating
his imagination, instead of his corn,&#8221; and by
the time she was in her place the color had faded, the
waxen pallor was back upon her face, and the small
incident had been safely passed.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Linda was lying on, or perhaps
I should say clinging to, the hard and slippery thing
they called a sofa&mdash;Heaven save the mark! It was
long and hard, and smoothly covered with shiny leather.
It arched up in its middle over very powerful springs,
and the springs and the slipperiness did the trick for
every one. You could not snuggle on it to save your
life, and if you attempted to be friendly with it and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
tried to rest your book or fan or smelling bottle beside
you&mdash;hoop la!&mdash;with an intensity of malice known only
to the inanimate enemy it would hitch up its back and
fire everything off onto the floor well out of your
reach&mdash;and if you showed any marked annoyance it
would fire you after them. There was not a day that
it did not shoot Miss Linda&#8217;s pillow from under her
head, and twice I saw it slide her bodily to the floor.</p>

<p>I had found just one thing that could hold on to
this slippery fiend, and that was a blanket&mdash;but who on
earth wanted to lie on a blanket in the summer-time?
So there Miss Linda lay on the glassy-surfaced &#8220;sofa,&#8221;
with a chair pushed close up to it to prevent her sliding
off, and I on the floor slowly fanning her and hoping
she might be asleep, she was so very quiet. But no,
she was not sleeping, for presently, without opening her
eyes or making the least movement, she whispered:
&#8220;Little sister, you saved three of us much grief and
pain by your caution and your thoughtfulness to-day,
and now, dear, I will explain about the picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned hot and shame-faced, and rubbing my head
upon her hands like an affectionate young puppy, I
muttered confusedly, &#8220;that, if she pleased, I&#8217;d rather
not!&#8221; But she smiled; not her family smile, but a sad,
slow smile, and stroked my hair and went on gently: &#8220;It
is right that you should know. He, the man of the
miniature, was to have been my&mdash;&#8221; She stopped; she
swallowed hard at something. She moistened her lips
and started again: &#8220;He&mdash;at least, I was to have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
his wife! I wore his ring&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; Suddenly her
eyes opened wide on mine, and she said with a sort of
rush: &#8220;Child, child! Heaven will have to be a very
glorious place to make me forget the happiness I
knew with him! and I loved him so! oh, I loved
him so!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a very transport of sympathy I broke in: &#8220;But
he was good, I am sure he was! and he don&#8217;t look as if
he were dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled kindly at me, and fully understood
my blundering, hurried words: &#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;you are right; he is not dead, and he is good! A little
hard, perhaps&mdash;&#8221; Her eyes closed again. &#8220;Yes,
perhaps, a little hard, but&mdash;well, men must be hard or
they cannot succeed! We were very happy, dear!
Papa&mdash;&#8221; Her brows drew together quickly for a moment;&mdash;&#8220;papa
gave his consent. He&mdash;Roger&mdash;had a
noble voice; we sang together at the church, we rode,
we planned&mdash;we planned&mdash;&#8221; A pause, a long, long, shivering
sigh, and then: &#8220;Papa changed his mind. I was
not of age&mdash;even had I been, I had been bred up to
such strict obedience&mdash;I&mdash;oh, I don&#8217;t know!&mdash;but
Roger, he could not bear dependence on another man&#8217;s
whims for two long years! He was one of the college
professors; he needed quiet, regularity, positively settled
plans, or the quality of his work might suffer!
Papa broke his promise&mdash;he gave no reason. Roger
said &#8216;he was jealous of us.&#8217; I only know he broke
his promise! Roger would not wait! Father commanded&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
demanded! They were two angry men&mdash;I
stood between them, dear&mdash;and I am crushed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;he did not love you hard enough,
dear Miss Linda! What was enduring two years of
Mr. Hyler compared to enduring a whole life without
<i>you</i>?&#8221; It was not exactly a polite way to speak of the
reverend gentleman or of her lover, and she laid her finger
on my lips, as she resumed: &#8220;Papa does not understand&mdash;time
has passed&mdash;but, oh, child, child!&mdash;each
day of my life&mdash;I lose my love&mdash;each day the pain of
it&mdash;is fresh and new! Had papa known of the picture
to-day&mdash;he might have understood&mdash;he might have&mdash;suffered
remorse&mdash;and he is old and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8216;As we
forgive those who trespass against us!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her whisper died away on the last word; she lay
quite still. I fanned her gently, slowly, and kissed her
little, paper-dry hands now and then, and by-and-by the
smile faded quite away, the sweet lips took a downward
droop, the heavy waves of her brown hair made
her face look piteously small and wasted, and, with hot
tears dropping down into my lap, I took my first look
at the real Linda. The little songster, with the song
stopped in her throat! The loving little woman, with
her heart crushed in her breast!&mdash;and as it was my first
so it was my last look at that Linda, for it was the only
time I ever saw her asleep, and when awake she was
always on dress-parade, and wore her smile as an officer
would his sword.</p>

<p>Shortly after this I began to worry, for though I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
still in ignorance, even I could see that as these hot days
went panting by each one of them took with it some
small portion of dear Miss Linda&#8217;s strength. The dandelion
in seed, lifting in air its phantom, downy
globe, was scarcely whiter, lighter or more frail than
she. Then I was worried about myself. The family
were taking suddenly too deep an interest in me,
my tastes and my desires. I was even asked what I
would do under such and such circumstances, or how I
would decide between this claim and that, and when I
entered a room the &#8220;grown-ups&#8221; were almost sure, of
late, to stop speaking, or they would clear their
throats and speak of the weather with an elephantine
lightness that could not deceive a goggle-eyed infant
negotiating teeth with a rubber ring.</p>

<p>Once my very own mother, speaking excitedly, too,
stopped short when I came in, and though I looked and
looked at her with forty-horse questioning power in my
eyes, she answered nothing, and my most penetrating
and gimlet-like glance finally brought out a very brief,
not to say sharp, suggestion that I sit down and stare
at my spelling-book awhile&mdash;which, like most good
advice, was neither kindly given nor willingly followed.
So I was worrying, when one morning I stood listening
to Miss Linda&#8217;s unspeakably sad music. She was
playing with fervor and more strength than usual, and
suddenly she was seized with a paroxysm of coughing.
Instead of going to her at once, I ran into the next
room for some troches that were on a table, and before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
I could return with them she had fallen and was lying
motionless on the floor. My cry and the shouts of
little Arthur gave the alarm. Mrs. Hyler entered
first. She went very white, but she stooped and lifted
Linda like a child, and I thought it strange that, as she
carried her, she held a handkerchief to her face. Mr.
Hyler appearing suddenly, exclaimed in excited tones:
&#8220;Ice&mdash;ice! Salt&mdash;linen!&#8221; and, taking these exclamations
as orders, I ran forward, intending to carry the
message to my mother. At that moment Mrs. Hyler
stretched out her hand to push the door more widely
open, and on the breast of her light dress, just where
Miss Linda&#8217;s head was resting, a great, red stain was
slowly, evilly spreading. I glanced from it to the handkerchief
in her hand, and it was red! red!! red!!!
With stiffening lips, I whispered: &#8220;Miss Linda&mdash;oh,
Miss Linda!&#8221; and suddenly there came a mighty roaring
in my ears&mdash;a cold air on my face, and as I sank
into the windy darkness, afar off I heard a voice cry:
&#8220;There she goes! Catch the child&mdash;ah! she saw it
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, in very truth I had seen all! And when,
with a general sense of discomfort, I opened my eyes
upon the sunlight again, I found myself attended by
two of the seven sons, who cast water on me with lavish
hand and pounded me with an affectionate brutality
that left marks by which my fainting might be remembered
for days after. I looked stupidly at them at
first and wondered, and then I saw that great, red, growing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
stain beneath the wasted, white face, and I broke
into such sobs as fairly frightened them. I was crouching
on the top step of the porch, with my feet drawn up
and my arms and head resting on my knees, and as I
glanced downward I saw four bare, brown, boyish feet,
and noted how restless they were. With my heart
almost bursting with pain, some portion of my brain
made a note of the fact that one of the four great toes
before me had received a recent cut that must
have been given by a hoe. Then the elder one
thumped me kindly on the back and said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t,
Carrie, don&#8217;t!&#8221;&mdash;and the other one said, in a husky
voice: &#8220;Why, didn&#8217;t yo&#8217; never know at all that sister
Linda was a-goin&#8217; to die?&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave an agonized cry at the words, and the elder
boy exclaimed: &#8220;What did yer want to say that for?
For two cents I&#8217;d give yer a good lickin&#8217;!&#8221;&mdash;while he,
of the toe, said: &#8220;No, yer won&#8217;t give me a lickin&#8217; for
two cents, nor for one cent, neither!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why won&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t Jack eat his supper, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then they grabbed at each other over my head,
but a grave voice said: &#8220;Boys, I never was so shamed
by you before!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Alfred, the eldest of the seven, and a &#8220;grown-up&#8221;
himself. He paid no attention to their explanations&mdash;their
recriminations; he simply stooped, and,
lifting my shaking body in his arms, carried me into the
house. As he was going up the narrow stairs a splash<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
came on my cheek that was no tear of mine. A thrill
went through me from head to foot&mdash;I lifted my
swollen lids to look at him. His face wore that gray
tint paleness brings to dark people, and in his always
sad eyes I saw slow tears gathering. I buried my own
face in his bosom, and laying my shaking, little hand
across his eyes, I sobbed: &#8220;Don&#8217;t, oh, please don&#8217;t!
She couldn&#8217;t bear it if she knew!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took me to my mother&#8217;s room and, placing me
high against the pillows, deftly tied a wet handkerchief
about my hot brows, and then he stood looking down
at me for a moment before he said, with a quivering
voice: &#8220;You know now, don&#8217;t you, Carrie?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded my head and wrung my hands silently.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;she is going soon, dear&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;it&#8217;s
rough! Good God! Carrie! if you could
have seen her three years ago&mdash;if you could have heard
her sing! I think sometimes my father is a devil!
There&mdash;there&mdash;I didn&#8217;t mean to say that!&mdash;but see,
dear, little girl!&#8221; He knelt down quickly by the bed
and took my hands in his. He spoke rapidly&mdash;pressing
my fingers tightly, to hold my attention: &#8220;They are
going to ask you to do something&mdash;to-morrow, perhaps&mdash;this
awful attack of Linda&#8217;s will hurry things&mdash;I
can&#8217;t tell you <i>what</i> they will ask; I have not the time,
but, Carrie, refuse! Don&#8217;t be badgered&mdash;don&#8217;t be
coaxed&mdash;not even by darling Linda! One martyr is
enough! Refuse, refuse! for, oh, we will be a hard lot
when sister has left us!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>His body shook with sobs; for a moment he let his
head rest on the edge of the bed. Then he rose and
left the room to go to his own, where I heard him lock
himself in. And that day ended my ignorance about
Miss Linda&#8217;s fate, and it also ended Miss Linda&#8217;s
music&mdash;she had played her last note.</p>

<p>That I had received a shock was evident to the whole
family, and I heard the sick girl say to her father:
&#8220;Wait, papa, dear, don&#8217;t speak to Carrie yet&mdash;give
her a little time.&#8221;</p>

<p>But my grief was greater than my curiosity, and I
never asked myself what he could have to speak to me
about, or what he could possibly ask of me. I only
thought of her&mdash;to fan her, hand her a drink, bring
her a flower, carry a message, or, above all, during
that afternoon hour, to crouch at her side and watch
her &#8220;silent singing,&#8221; as I called it. She never seemed
to do it before her mother or anyone but me. But
while she was supposed to be taking a nap, and I
fanned her quietly, she would lie, with closed eyes, and
softly beat time with her shadowy hand, and her throat
would swell and her lips move, but no sound came;
and through much watching of her, with my heart in
my eyes, I came to know what she sang. Often it was
&#8220;Lead, Kindly Light,&#8221; but more often, to my torture
now, it was that expression of absolute submission,
&#8220;Just as I Am, Without One Plea.&#8221; And when her
pale lips found the words, &#8220;O, Lamb of God, I Come,&#8221;
I would bite my lips and hold my breath, that I might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
not break into the wild sobs that would have sore
distressed her.</p>

<p>I had not liked the Rev. Hyler at any time, but
when I learned that, minister as he was, the sole religious
observance for the family was a hasty, almost
angry, snatch at a blessing on the food, while for
visitors there were family prayers both night and
morning, my dislike became marked. Linda saw it as
she saw everything, and unable to defend him, she suffered
and was ashamed, but kept silent until that hot
afternoon, when she said: &#8220;Little sister, you are not
fond of papa, but try, dear&mdash;to put out of your mind&mdash;that
matter of the prayers, and only think how old
and tired and tried he is&mdash;and&#8221; (I heard his step
approaching, and his dry, little cough)&mdash;&#8220;and listen to
him kindly&mdash;and try to do what he asks of you&mdash;try,
dear, for all our sakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, to my bewilderment, the Rev. Hyler and
his worn and helpless wife made solemn entry and
seated themselves, and I, having risen respectfully,
stood there and received the blood-curdling proposal
that I should become the sister of the seven&mdash;the
adopted daughter of the Rev. Hyler! Amazement
kept me silent, and they went on to explain, with their
eyes turned away from Linda&#8217;s face, &#8220;how bad it
would be for the boys to be without a sister&#8217;s influence&mdash;and
how they had been greatly gratified, though
much surprised, to see that the younger boys had taken
a strong liking to me,&#8221; and, glancing at their two grim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
faces, I wondered what they would say or do if they
knew that their boys&#8217; liking was founded upon a
generous but downright falsehood, told by me to save
the second youngest from a most unjust and cruel
thrashing; after which I had gone at once to my
mother, confessed the lie and accepted my punishment
with a cheerful acquiescence that filled the seven with
admiration and made them declare, with enthusiastic
vulgarity, that I was &#8220;the biggest thing on ice!&#8221;</p>

<p>At last it dawned upon them that, for mere form&#8217;s
sake, they should ask an answer from me, and it came
in a swift and emphatic &#8220;NO!&#8221; They were surprised
and angry, but to all their half-sneering questions&mdash;as
to why and wherefore&mdash;wide-eyed and amazed, I had
but one word for answer: &#8220;Mother!&#8221; The Rev.
Hyler answered: &#8220;My wife will be your mother!&#8221;&mdash;and
I almost laughed; then with large conclusiveness I
replied: &#8220;But my mother loves me, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Linda caught my hand and said: &#8220;Think,
Carrie&mdash;a home&mdash;brothers&mdash;father and mother to love
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him a walking bitterness, I looked at her
a withering disappointment and said: &#8220;No! no, dear
Miss Linda, they love you, but they would not love me&mdash;and&#8221;
I triumphantly added, &#8220;they will not tell
you so!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned questioningly to them, but the challenge
was not accepted. Angrily her father bade me go, saying,
&#8220;I might know what hunger was some day.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>But I answered cheerfully: &#8220;Oh, I have been
hungry sometimes, and so has mother, but we were
together, so it was all right. You know when you&#8217;re
orphans and widows, you always come all right&#8221;&mdash;a
speech that was as perfect in faith as it was imperfect
in grammar.</p>

<p>The Rev. Hyler, with a vindictive gleam in his
eye, &#8220;hoped I might be hungry again, that I might
appreciate what I was rejecting&#8221;&mdash;and Miss Linda
kissed me with a disappointed face, and whispered for
me to go, now.</p>

<p>After that life became intolerable there, and soon
there came a morning when, ready for an early start, I
crept into Miss Linda&#8217;s room and knelt down by her bed,
and with hands tight-clasped we looked&mdash;and looked&mdash;and
looked, and spoke not one word between us. Then
there came a call for me, and I rose to go. As I bent
over to kiss her, she lifted a thin, little, warning hand
and tried to turn my face away, but with a smothered
cry of indignation, I caught her hand and held it
while I slipped my other arm beneath her incredibly
frail shoulders, and lifting her, I kissed her shadowy
hair, her brow, her cheeks and her pale, dry lips. Then
with a long, long look into her dark, sapphire-blue eyes,
I laid her down and went out, and saw her no more
forever. As I closed the door gently behind me, I
heard, for the last time, the husky whisper that had
grown so dear to me, and all it said was, &#8220;Little
sister!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>I stumbled down the stairs, and slipping my hand
into my mother&#8217;s, we faced the world once more, I
having faith to believe that somewhere in its mighty
length and breadth there was a home for us, and that
together we should somehow find it.</p>

<p>For two years the gentle, little silent singer had been
lying in her lonely and neglected grave, when I paid
my only visit to the Hyler family. Circumstances had
brought me into the neighborhood, and I felt in duty
bound to &#8220;pay my respects,&#8221; as they called it. Poor
Alfred&#8217;s fear seemed to have been justified, for the
neighbors declared that since Linda&#8217;s death the boys
had become a &#8220;hard lot,&#8221; and seemed actually to be
growing more boldly bad week by week.</p>

<p>The Rev. Hyler and his wife at first seemed to
derive a sort of sour satisfaction from my visit to them.
The boys received me with noisy greetings and many
poundings on the shoulders, and young savages that
they were, they expressed their hospitality by the
making of gifts, such as horse-hair rings, matched jack-stones,
and several chunks of not-too-clean flag-root,
both the smell and taste of which were particularly
offensive to me.</p>

<p>Before tea was over all the kindness had gone out
of Mrs. Hyler&#8217;s face, and it began to wear the look I
had known well in former days, of dull, sullen dissatisfaction.
Suddenly, apropos of nothing, she said: &#8220;I
suppose, Carrie, you have heard all about Linda?&#8221;</p>

<p>With some hesitation I answered: &#8220;Yes, I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
so. I heard that she&mdash;she went away in her sleep, and
that you held her hand&mdash;but never knew when&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; she broke in, angrily, &#8220;and they told you,
too, that I had sat there asleep, or I would have
known&mdash;I know their tales.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, Mrs. Hyler,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;indeed no one ever
implied such a cruel thing! They only said she passed
so gently that no one could have known the actual
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed somewhat mollified by this assurance,
and went on more rapidly, and as she spoke she slowly
turned her cup round and round in its saucer: &#8220;Linda
had been so much better that last day that it seemed
almost foolish when she expressed her wish to see each
one of the boys alone for a few minutes. I told her
so, but she only smiled and said, &#8216;so much the better
for the boys.&#8217; The memory of her last words to them
should not be associated with suffering and pain, and
so she had her way, and held each brother in her arms
and whispered some last words&mdash;but smiling, smiling
all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I clasped my hands tight beneath the table, and my
heart seemed to beat out those cruel words, &#8220;smiling,
smiling all the time,&#8221; and I whispered &#8220;Miss Linda,
oh, dear Miss Linda!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and she had a little gift for each&mdash;and&mdash;well,
later in the afternoon she was lying on the sofa, her
eyes were closed, and beneath the cover her hand
seemed to be moving all the time. Perhaps she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
nervous, but she was saying, or repeating-to-herself-like,
the words&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not help it&mdash;from my lips sprang the line:
&#8220;Just as I Am, Without One Plea!&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed a sort of general exclamation, and
Mr. Hyler leaned forward, saying sharply: &#8220;How&#8217;s
this? Who gave you your information&mdash;not the boys,
I&#8217;m sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hot and confused, I said: &#8220;Nobody told me, I had
only guessed,&#8221; (his disbelief was palpable) &#8220;because
dear Miss Linda was so very fond of that hymn, and
sang it nearly every day to herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mr. Hyler sneeringly assured me that, as Linda
has lost her voice more than a year before her death,
my statement had at least the element of surprise
about it!&#8221; I sat mute&mdash;I could not explain to them
about the silent singing.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Hyler took up the hateful ball and sent
it rolling toward me with the suggestion, &#8220;that as I
was a good guesser, perhaps I had guessed all that she
had been going to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>I steadied my voice and answered, respectfully,
&#8220;that I had not guessed anything else,&#8221; and with
mock surprise she said: &#8220;Indeed?&#8221; and then went on:
&#8220;After a silence Linda spoke of you, Carrie.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up joyfully&mdash;my mortification all forgotten:
&#8220;She said you were a remarkable girl&#8221; (even at that
moment I was proud that she had not called me child,
but &#8220;girl&#8221;). &#8220;I told her you were well enough, but in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
no way remarkable. She insisted, however, and then
added, that if I ever saw you again I was to give you
a remembrance. I thought the gift she chose very odd
and unattractive, but she said&#8221; (how slowly she was
speaking now) &#8220;she said you would understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused so long that I looked up. Her eyes were
like a ferret&#8217;s, and Mr. Hyler, with his head in his hand,
was watching me from between his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I whispered, faintly, vaguely. Then
she spoke loudly, roughly: &#8220;She told me to give you
a handkerchief, and say to you, the longer you lived
the better you would understand her gratitude, for
your <i>golden silence</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt the blood fairly pushing through my veins&mdash;my
downcast eyes noted that the very backs of my hands
were turning red. Then Mrs. Hyler struck the table
sharply and said: &#8220;Well, was she right&mdash;do you
understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had no time to answer, for Mr. Hyler sprang up
and, violently thrusting his chair against the wall,
cried: &#8220;What folly to ask the question&mdash;of course she
understands! Is not her knowledge burning red in
her face?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped across the room and flung wide the door
leading to his <i>study</i>, as he termed it&mdash;the boys called
it &#8220;The Place of Horrors,&#8221; because they were always
thrashed there with peculiar malevolence and ingenuity,
and generally unjustly&mdash;they seldom got punished when
they deserved it. There he waved me in. But grave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
and stern, Alfred&#8217;s voice came: &#8220;Father&mdash;father!
Carrie is but a child&mdash;she is here alone, and she is a
visitor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Visitor or no visitor!&#8221; was the answer, &#8220;I will
not permit this stranger, this mere nobody, to have
knowledge of my daughter that is unknown to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>With wistful voice I meekly asked Mrs. Hyler:
&#8220;Please ma&#8217;am, may I have the handkerchief?&#8221; and
she sharply answered: &#8220;No&mdash;no! you shall have no
handkerchief&#8221; (Alfred quickly left the room a
moment) &#8220;until you have confessed every word that
ever passed between you and Linda!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Alfred came in again and, leaning over,
placed in my hand the little gift, and kissing me, gently
said: &#8220;There, Carrie, it was Linda&#8217;s own!&#8221; Then as he
passed his mother, he laid his hand on her shoulder and
said: &#8220;Dear mother, it was not yours to withhold&mdash;we
must all honor sister&#8217;s wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hyler fairly shouted: &#8220;Take your seat and be
silent, sir! As for you,&#8221; (turning to me) &#8220;into that
room! I will know what conduct my daughter was
guilty of that she should be grateful for the shelter of
your &#8216;golden silence&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>The four eldest boys sprang furiously to their feet,
but the cry that rang the wildest in that room, that
might have been the cry of a woman-grown, came from
my lips. I stood gasping a moment, and all I thought
was: &#8220;Miss Linda, oh my Miss Linda&mdash;he insulted
you&mdash;he&mdash;he, whom you always spared!&#8221; And then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
I began to grow cold&mdash;bodily, mentally! My shamefacedness,
my fear, all fell away from me. I must
have gone very white, for No. 5, a rather timid, gentle
boy, said lowly: &#8220;Oh, mother, will Carrie faint? She
won&#8217;t die too, will she?&#8221;</p>

<p>I lifted my eyes to the Rev. Hyler, and I felt a great
contempt for him; while down deep in my heart there
was growing a bitter anger that merged, at last, into
a vindictive longing to see him suffer. I threw up my
head and marched into &#8220;The Place of Horrors,&#8221; and
turning, waited for him to follow me. He paused and
looked at me with the same gleam in his eyes that
shone there the day he wished &#8220;I might know hunger
again.&#8221; Then, with petty triumph, he exclaimed:
&#8220;When you leave this room I shall understand this
thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was only partially right, for when I left that
room he understood several things. He banged the
door shut, and then seated himself at his writing table,
leaving me to stand at his opposite side, as a culprit
stands before a judge. I looked at him and saw all
the narrow, gray man&#8217;s meanness, his eager curiosity
that was like that of a scandal-monger&#8217;s. Yet, I gave
him one chance, for when he demanded: &#8220;Well, now,
Miss?&#8221; I said: &#8220;Mr. Hyler, you <i>must</i> know, there is
nothing wrong about dear Miss Linda&#8217;s kind message
to me&mdash;she simply&mdash;&#8221; &#8220;Stop, where you are!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have no prevarication! Where there is secrecy
there is shame! No one ever conceals what is right!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
I&#8217;ll have the truth, now, and the meaning of this message!&#8221;</p>

<p>And I answered: &#8220;Yes, sir, you shall have the truth!&#8221;
and I told him briefly of Miss Linda&#8217;s silent singing,
and of her undying sorrow for her lost lover. As I
spoke, utter amazement grew upon his face&mdash;he stammered
out: &#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;what are you saying? She
never spoke of him! Why&mdash;nearly three years had
passed&mdash;since&mdash;since&mdash;the&mdash;r&mdash;the break&mdash;and &#8217;er&mdash;you
don&#8217;t know what you are talking about&mdash;she did
not grieve!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she did!&#8221; I tranquilly replied. &#8220;That
was why she would never have a light in her room at
night for fear the picture might be seen. She slept
with it beneath her cheek, and washed it with her tears,
and dried it with her kisses. Oh, yes, she grieved!&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes began to look sunken and his face was
working convulsively. Then I told him how I had
found the picture and wrapped it in a handkerchief
and had given it silently to her in his presence, and she
had been grateful, not because she was ashamed of her
love or her sorrow, but because she wished to spare
him suffering. And with his clenched fist he struck
the table, blow after blow, crying furiously: &#8220;You
lie&mdash;you baggage&mdash;you lie!&#8221; Then suddenly turning
his trembling hands palms upward, he pleaded:
&#8220;Carrie&mdash;tell me that you lie!&#8221; But coldly I answered:
&#8220;I do not lie at all, sir&mdash;and you know I do not&mdash;besides,
here are dear Miss Linda&#8217;s very own words:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
&#8216;Every day of my life I lose my love&mdash;and every day
the pain is fresh and new!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes roamed from side to side&mdash;little bubbles
formed in the corners of his lips, his hand went up to
his throat and tried to loosen his collar, and I could
just hear the whispered words that left his lips:
&#8220;Linda&mdash;Linda&mdash;Linda!&#8221; and then, I struck my last
blow at him. (Oh, Miss Linda, to-day, I ask your
pardon, but then I was hard and pitiless, as only the
very young can be.) And I went coldly on: &#8220;She said
to me, she did not wish you to know of her sorrow, because,
<i>perhaps</i>&#8221;&mdash;I leaned on the table and brought myself
nearer to him&mdash;&#8220;<i>perhaps</i> you <i>might</i> feel remorse!&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw one hand above his head and gave a cry:
&#8220;Perhaps? perhaps? only perhaps?&#8221; and suddenly
fell forward on the table, with outspread arms, and I
heard him call upon the God he had never truly served
and ask the mercy he had denied his own child! And,
as I left the room by a second door opening into the
entry where hung my hat and cloak, the vindictive
devil that possessed me made me say quite clearly:
&#8220;As a father pitieth his own children!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was tying on my hat when I distinctly heard the
boys quarreling as to whether or no there would be
prayers held in my honor&mdash;some saying, &#8220;yes, because
I was company,&#8221; and the younger ones arguing that, as
I was not a &#8220;grown-up,&#8221; &#8220;there&#8217;d be no family prayers,&#8221;
then suddenly there was a howl, and I knew they
were coming to blows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>I slipped from the house, without good-bye to any
one, and as I passed the study window, I glanced in
and saw the &#8220;gray head&#8221; bowed upon the table and
two hands beating feebly, aimlessly, and suddenly I
seemed to hear Miss Linda&#8217;s husky whisper saying:
&#8220;And only remember how old and tired and tried he
is, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>And I cried aloud: &#8220;Forgive me, forgive me, dear
Miss Linda&mdash;I did it because I loved you so!&#8221; and
looking across the years&mdash;I say now&mdash;I love you so,
dear <span class="smcap">Little Silent Singer</span>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">An Old Hulk</h2>
</div>


<p>Old Thomas Brockwell&mdash;sometimes called Bull
Brockwell, he of the mighty thews and sinews&mdash;had
been for some years a widower, and had he remained
a widower I should have been the poorer by one good
friend&mdash;a lowly one&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;but you know that true
friendship is one of the few things the lowly can afford
to give.</p>

<p>But the broad-shouldered, ruddy-faced old Briton had
married an American wife in the person of the mother
of my closest chum&mdash;and so I learned many things
about the narrow, hard, honest old giant&mdash;things that
sometimes filled my eyes with tears of laughter; sometimes
with stinging drops of anguished pity. The only
surprising thing about Brockwell&#8217;s second marriage
was that it had not taken place years before&mdash;for
given a working-class Englishman of middle age&mdash;owning
a house of his own&mdash;you have the worst material
in the world for a widower. But, like most of his race,
he was a bit contrary, and when all his housekeepers
and his elderly unmarried friends pursued him openly&mdash;without
even trying to hide the matrimonial <i>lasso</i> with
a few flowers of sentiment or delicacy&mdash;he shook his
obstinate, old head and plunged away.</p>

<p>Then Emily had arrived upon the scene, whom he
described as &#8220;a fine figure of a woman&#8221; (she weighed
something over two hundred), and if she was too inert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
to join in the general pursuit of him, she was also too
inert to <i>avoid</i> pursuit herself&mdash;hence the marriage, and
though, while praising her housekeeping, he openly
expressed his doubts of her soul&#8217;s salvation&mdash;the new,
phlegmatic Mrs. Brockwell remained quite undisturbed.
She was an experienced chewer of gum&mdash;she said
she <i>had</i> to chew it to aid her digestion&mdash;but be that as it
may, a certain mental clearness, a sort of spiritual calm,
seemed to come to her from her steady, cow-like munching.
On the occasion of her second marriage she had
contentedly chewed until she took her place before the
lean, old minister; then, having no bridesmaid to act
for her, she stuck her gum on her breast-pin, temporarily,
while she promised to accept the big party at her
side, and all his belongings, and to nurse him for the
rest of his life without further remuneration&mdash;and with
the nuptial benediction she had resumed her gum and
had gone forth a slowly-chewing, contented bride&mdash;and
on Sunday, he wishing, probably, to do all that was courteous
and polite under the circumstances, took his new
wife out to the cemetery and proceeded to introduce her&mdash;as
it were&mdash;to the other members of the family.</p>

<p>A hideous chunk of stone stood in the middle of a
plot, from which the graves rayed out like the spokes
of a wheel&mdash;and old Thomas, with a cane, which so surely
only appeared on Sundays that a bad little boy once
said: &#8220;God made the Sabbath day and old Brockwell&#8217;s
cane!&#8221;&mdash;with this cane he immediately bored a little
hole at the foot of one grave and remarked: &#8220;I buried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
my <i>first</i> wife there&#8221;&mdash;and Emily brought her jaws to
with a snap, and bowed her head slightly, as though
acknowledging an introduction. Then she chewed
again, and old Thomas yanked out the cane with some
effort, as though Mrs. Brockwell No. 1 was holding on
to it. Then he bored another little hole at the foot of
another grave with the cane and announced: &#8220;I buried
my eldest son here&#8221;&mdash;another stoppage of the jaws
and another bow&mdash;and so the old &#8220;borer&#8221; went on,
till each member of the family had been presented to
the new-comer in turn, and then he gave the final touch
of brightness to this very original bridal outing by
carefully measuring with the cane the space, to see if
there was enough left for two more spokes to his family
&#8220;wheel of death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Brockwell was wont to declare she would
remember that day as long as she lived. Not because
her sensibilities were wounded, but because she had
not been constructed for rapid action, and she declared
she would never have lived through the homeward walk
but for the sustaining power of an extra piece of gum,
which she luckily had in her pocket&mdash;for this was
the golden age of the world when women still had
pockets.</p>

<p>Old Thomas Brockwell narrowly&mdash;very narrowly&mdash;escaped
being a religious monomaniac. Unquestionably
sincere, his religion was yet a thing so warped
and bitter as to fill most people with shrinking dread.
He studied only the Old Testament, rarely reading the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
New. In his ears the rolling thunders of Sinai
drowned the gentle &#8220;Voice&#8221; preaching from the
&#8220;Mount.&#8221; He believed in a personal Devil&mdash;he
believed in a material Hell.</p>

<p>I have never known anyone who got as much
satisfaction out of the <i>whole</i> of his religion as he got
out of Hell alone. He talked of it, thought of it, and,
in regretful tones, told many of his friends that they were
going <i>there</i>. All its accessories were dear to him. The
&#8220;brimstone,&#8221; the &#8220;burning lake&#8221; and that &#8220;undying
worm,&#8221; which seemed, in his imagination, something
between a boaconstrictor and a Chinese dragon, while
the &#8220;bottomless pit&#8221; not only gave him two words to
roll sweetly under his tongue, but provided an ideal place
to shake frightened little boys over at Sunday-school&mdash;for
he labored faithfully Sunday after Sunday to
frighten sinful youth into the church or the idiot
asylum.</p>

<p>His God was a bitterly revengeful God! The Bible
told him to fear Him and to obey His commandments.
The base of his religion was &#8220;an eye for an eye&mdash;a
tooth for a tooth!&#8221; He knew no &#8220;turning of the other
cheek&#8221;&mdash;no &#8220;forgiveness of enemies,&#8221; and many a
time, in his efforts to show his disapproval of the loving,
gentle, yet strong teaching of the New Testament, he
blasphemed unconsciously. Few things made him so
angry as to suggest &#8220;a Hell of remorse&#8221;&mdash;of &#8220;tortured
conscience&#8221;&mdash;of &#8220;mental agony&#8221;&mdash;while a hint at
&#8220;atonement&#8221;&mdash;a final winning of forgiveness&mdash;was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
rag so red as to set him madly charging through the
harshest and most cruelly just punishments meted out
in the Bible&mdash;and the worse one promised for the
future&mdash;<i>Hell</i>! &#8220;And <i>their</i> future is <i>now</i>!&#8221; he would
shout, with glaring eyes! &#8220;<i>Now</i>, do you understand?
All these disobedient servants of the Lord are in fiery
torments <i>now!</i> and <i>will</i> be forever! Ah! it&#8217;s a big
place&mdash;a <i>mighty</i> big place!&mdash;far and far away bigger
than Heaven! It has to be, there&#8217;s so many more to
go there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Night and morning he read a portion of the Bible,
and prayed loud and long&mdash;and right there he came in
conflict with his Emily. There was just one point they
differed on&mdash;they did not quarrel, because Emily was too
slow in speech. There&#8217;s no comfort to be had out of a
quarrel, unless it&#8217;s quick&mdash;<i>very</i> quick; and if Emily
had had her choice she would a good deal rather have
died than try to be quick.</p>

<p>The point of difference between this otherwise
peaceful pair was whether the chewing of gum was
un-Christianlike and disrespectful when indulged in
during family service. The first time he had caught
her in the heinous act he had roared out: &#8220;Woman,
have you no decency? Would you chaw the ten commandments
up into a hunk of gum?&#8221;</p>

<p>Emily had mildly stated that she chewed &#8220;to keep
herself awake,&#8221; and after many struggles it had come to
a compromise&mdash;she was only to chew while he read; <i>not</i>
while he prayed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>Emily explained matters to me one day in this way:
&#8220;You see, Mr. Brockwell, he gets riled up because I
chew gum while he&#8217;s reading gospel, but it&#8217;s really his
own fault; if he&#8217;d only read one chapter, like an ordinary
Christian man! My father, now, was a deacon,
and he never read mor&#8217;n one chapter at a time at family
service; but Mr. Brockwell, when he gets a smiting
people hip and thigh, and a raining down plagues and
things; why, there&#8217;s no stop to him; he goes right along
over ever so many chapters&mdash;and I don&#8217;t take to the stoning
and the killing&mdash;and so I go off to sleep, unless I
chew gum right hard. Why, never once since we&#8217;ve been
married has Mr. Brockwell been satisfied with the &#8216;Fall
of Jericho&#8217; for one reading. On he goes, and tackles
that city of &#8216;Ai,&#8217; and I always feel sorry when that line
comes about the &#8216;men and <i>women</i> that were slaughtered
bein&#8217; twelve thousand.&#8217; But, land sakes! it&#8217;s all sweeter
than honey to Mr. Brockwell&mdash;&#8217;specially the hanging of
the king, and piling stones on his body for the beginning
of an altar&mdash;nasty, bad-smelling idea I call it. <i>But</i> when
Mr. Brockwell begins with them &#8216;seven trumpets of rams&#8217;
horns&#8217; I begin to chew hard, for I know there&#8217;s a lot
to be gone over before praying begins. If he&#8217;d read
oftener about Hannah and little Samuel I&#8217;d keep
awake. Ain&#8217;t that a nice little Samuel on the mantel&mdash;his
left foot&#8217;s broken, but kneeling like that you&#8217;d
never know it, unless you turn him around.&#8221; That
being the sort of tangent Mrs. Emily was apt to go off
on during a conversation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>The old man might have lived without working at
that time, but he held idleness as sinful, so he, without
any feeling of shame, acted as night watchman in a
large building down town. One winter there were
many burglaries, and his employer grew a bit uneasy,
knowing his was a tempting establishment and remembering
that Thomas Brockwell was an elderly man. So
he asked his watchman if he would not like to have
some one to help him during the rest of the winter.
And Brockwell was hot with anger and answered that
he could take care of his employer&#8217;s property, but he
didn&#8217;t want to protect some young nincompoop
besides. &#8220;I am able to take care of any burglars that
come my way. A man of the Lord can always lick a
law-breaker,&#8221; and looking at the really splendid old
body of his watchman, the gentleman had laughingly
declared he &#8220;believed old Brockwell would be up to
two or three younger men!&#8221; and let him go his obstinate,
lonely way, and like many another word spoken
in jest, these words proved true.</p>

<p>One bitter night, after reading with great enjoyment
of the prompt action of the bears in the taking off of
those ribald little boys who had made unpleasant
remarks about the scarcity of hair among the prophets
(surprising how alike the boys of to-day are with the
boys of the scriptural epoch), and had prayed till
Emily had fallen asleep, with her face squelched in the
seat of the chair she knelt by, and had awakened
and acknowledged her fault. &#8220;For,&#8221; as she said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
me, &#8220;after he had fallen over my legs without waking
me, he might have thought I was lying if I had said I
was just thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I had quite agreed with her and complimented
her on her truthful nature&mdash;and he had taken his tin
pail of coffee in his mittened hand and his package of
sandwiches in his pocket and gone forth to his night&#8217;s
watch. He had been a sailor in his early manhood,
and, in addition to the tattooed anchor and star on the
backs of his hands, he still retained a few words from
his sailor&#8217;s vocabulary which he used now and then
with bewildering effect upon the landsmen. Mrs.
Brockwell found that habit particularly trying. She
was one of those women who always get drabbled when
they walk. Long street dresses were worn in her day,
and had she possessed six hands instead of two, she
would have failed still to keep her dress out of the wet
or the mud. On Sundays when she was crowded into
her best gown and was clutching her skirt in the most
useless places, trying to pick her way across a muddy
street, old Thomas was wont to exclaim from the rear:
&#8220;Take a reef in the la&#8217;board side of your petticoat,
Emily!&#8221; and Emily would hoist high the right side
instead, and the left would go trailing through the
mud, while the old man pounded the walk with his
Sunday cane, crying: &#8220;La&#8217;board&mdash;la&#8217;board&mdash;la&#8217;board,
not sta&#8217;board. Now just look at your sails! Oh,
woman, the ignorance of you at forty-six, not to know
your la&#8217;board from your sta&#8217;board side!&#8221; And meek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Emily never suggested that left and right were the
generally accepted terms for use on shore.</p>

<p>And as old Thomas walked through the biting cold,
he congratulated himself on the honesty his wife had
shown in admitting she had fallen asleep during
prayers, and said to himself that it was the end of <i>her</i>
day&#8217;s work and he supposed she was tired&mdash;and&mdash;&#8220;great
guns, how cold it was!&#8221; And so he maundered
on and reached his store and entered and made
his rounds, and finally at about two o&#8217;clock he took his
coffee from the heater and began to drink it, when he
paused&mdash;to listen. Then he put the coffee gently
down and stole softly to the office&mdash;and saw two men
at the safe, and with a cry, &#8220;Avast there!&#8221; he was
upon them, striving to grasp them both! The smaller
one was like an eel and had slipped from his clutch,
but the larger one he held on to, and after a short
struggle, he got his head &#8220;in chancery.&#8221; He had just
put in a couple of good blows&mdash;when he heard an
ominous click behind him&mdash;at the same instant the man
he was pounding fiercely growled: &#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t use
the &#8216;barker&#8217;&mdash;you fool, you&#8217;ll &#8216;jug&#8217; us all yet!
Choke the devil off, so I can do something&mdash;choke
him, I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>With beautiful obedience and the spring of a wild-cat,
No. 2 was on Brockwell&#8217;s back, and doing his best
to carry out orders. But it was that neck&mdash;that had
given rise to the name <i>Bull</i> Brockwell; and the small
ruffian tried in vain to get his clever thief&#8217;s fingers in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
a choking grasp about the massive throat; but his
weight was disturbing and distressing, and old Brockwell
loosed No. 1 for a moment, while he reached up
and tore the incubus from his shoulders. In the effort
he wheeled half round and found himself facing a third
man in the doorway. He had just time to note that
the man had a bull&#8217;s-eye lantern in one hand, some
weapon in the other, and wore a half-mask on his face&mdash;when
he received a crushing blow upon the head.
He felt the hot blood leap forth in swift response to
that savage gash. He staggered a bit, too, but did
not fall, to the amazement of the brawny scoundrel,
who exclaimed: &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be damned!&#8221; Those
words were like a veritable &#8220;slogan&#8221; to old Brockwell.
&#8220;Aye, aye,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;right you are, my
hearty! Damned you will be, sure, and the burning
lake of brimstone you&#8217;ll get for this night&#8217;s work!&#8221;
and then they were upon him. He threw No. 3 out of
the doorway and took that place himself, thus keeping
all of them before him, and like an old bear &#8220;baited&#8221;
by a pack of snapping, snarling dogs, he was slowly
driven back until he found himself in the room again
where stood his coffee. While he placed many blows
where they would do the most good, still a great many
more had fallen short. He felt his wind was going,
and the streaming blood from his head impaired his
sight, and just at that moment of threatened weakness
the little thief struck him in the face, not with his fist
but with his open hand&mdash;slapped him, in fact. With a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
roar of rage, old Brockwell caught up the pail and
dashed the hot coffee full into his assailant&#8217;s face, then
shouting, &#8220;You little whelp, you cur, you worm!&#8221;
with a mighty blow he drove the tin pail hard and tight
on to the thief&#8217;s head, half cutting off his ears with its
rim, and as the other men made at him, by a happy
fluke, he caught each man by the back of the neck and
with every ounce of power to be had from his great
arms and shoulders, he drove their two heads together
in a smashing blow, and dropped their bodies as a well-bred
terrier drops the rats he has shaken the life from.
Then he turned for the little foe, just in time to catch
upon his arm the blow that had been meant for his
heart, and, by the hot smarting of his skin, he knew he
had been cut by the little ruffian, whom he hammered
into submission easily. Then Bull Brockwell sounded
his whistle at the door for the police, and when they
came he laid his hand on one of the officers&#8217; shoulder
and faintly asked: &#8220;Why&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;you&mdash;hold still&mdash;officer?
You keep&mdash;going up&mdash;and down&mdash;,&#8221; and
then old Thomas went down, and for a time knew
neither prayer, nor burglar, nor even burning brimstone,
but only darkness.</p>

<p>When his senses came back to him he gave an exhibition
of what might be called pig-headed honesty.
There was a drug store and a doctor&#8217;s office about two
blocks away, and the policeman, on seeing the sorry
condition of the old man, urged him to go and have
his hurts cared for. <i>They</i> would see that all was safe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
during his absence, but he refused point blank, saying:
&#8220;If a man was a watchman, he watched! If he was a
night watchman he watched till the night was gone, or
deserved the &#8216;cat.&#8217; His employer paid him to stay
in that building till daylight, and he&#8217;d stay, and be
tended to afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half angrily the policeman exclaimed: &#8220;You
obstinate, old bull! Do you want to bleed to death,
then?&#8221; And the &#8220;bull,&#8221; with some embarrassment,
had acknowledged that he did not really desire death,
but with a sigh of satisfaction, he suddenly announced:
&#8220;The Lord will settle all that. All I&#8217;ve got to do&mdash;is
my duty&mdash;and though I don&#8217;t feel just what you
might call&mdash;hearty&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;guess&mdash;I&#8217;ll hold out&mdash;till
time&#8217;s up and&mdash;&#8221; and his gray white lips trembled
into silence.</p>

<p>The policeman, finding him immovable in his determination,
sent for help, and soon the battered &#8220;old
Brockwell&#8221; was being washed and strapped and bandaged
and stitched, and had a few feet of plaster over
some strained muscles, and was generally &#8220;made over.&#8221;
And then the stunned burglars had recovered their
scattered senses and received a smiling and joyous
welcome from the policemen, such as is only offered
when the lost is found&mdash;and indeed one of these gentlemen
had been lost&mdash;from the penitentiary&mdash;for
several months. When the party of three were rounded
up, ready for an early morning stroll to the station
house, No. 1 had turned to Brockwell and growled:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
&#8220;See here, you old slugger, next time I come up
against you just hit me over the head with a loaded
cane, or the butt-end of a revolver or something <i>soft</i>
like that, will you? I don&#8217;t want to be &#8216;put out&#8217; no
more with another &#8216;mug&#8217;s&#8217; head, now I tell you fair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A&mdash;a&mdash;ah!&#8221; cried the little fellow, &#8220;he&#8217;s a fightin&#8217;
freak, he is! He ought to be a doin&#8217; time for jamming
a tin pail over a man&#8217;s head and half cutting off
his ears!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they went forth, cursing the night they had
tackled &#8220;old Bull Brockwell!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he had returned home, &#8220;sans buttons et sans
reproche,&#8221; and finding a barrel of flour standing at the
side door, had picked it up and carried it into the house,
apparently to convince himself that he was not much
hurt. Then, beginning to feel stiff and lame, he put
himself into Emily&#8217;s hands, and she promptly put him
into his bed, and scrambled through the &#8220;Fall of
Jericho,&#8221; stuck her gum upon the bed-post while she
did it, then she had looked at his head and said, &#8220;she&#8217;d
no idea a man could sew so neatly!&#8221; and then old
Brockwell got hot and feverish, and his eye and cheek
had blackened, and the doctor said he must be kept
quiet a few days, at which dictum Emily had groaned
aloud: &#8220;Kept quiet? Him? Good Lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, truly, had she been alone with him those days,
her work would have been cut out for her. The ideal
&#8220;bull in a china shop&#8221; would have proved an inoffensive
and lymphatic creature compared to this pawing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
plunging, irritable old Bull Brockwell! Bad enough
at any time, when his eyes had swelled so he could no
longer by the aid of his Bible put women and children
to &#8220;the edge of the sword,&#8221; nor erect altars, nor even
calculate the dollars&#8217; worth of a &#8220;wedge of gold of fifty
shekels weight,&#8221; he proceeded to fret himself into a
fever, and I was moved partly by pity and partly, I
am sorry to say, by a spirit of mischief, to seat myself
by his side, and with the air of one who carefully
selects a soothing and pleasant topic for sick-room conversation,
I brought forward the subject of eternal punishment,
and for my reward had his fixed attention in
a moment.</p>

<p>For a time he expatiated on the strong points of that
place of torment, seeing no inconsistency in <i>paving</i> with
broken promises a <i>bottomless</i> pit, and as he began to
run down, assuming the air of one eager for information,
I asked his opinion of that place of eternal coldness&mdash;that
frozen lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coldness&mdash;coldness?&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t
seem to remember!&#8221; and then another thought came to
him and he broke out: &#8220;Fine! Splendid! I never felt
such pain in my life as when I went near a fire with my
frosted hands. Cold <i>and</i> fire! That&#8217;s good! Ah, it
would have been better to have respected them commandments&mdash;only
ten of &#8217;em too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Egged on by his evident satisfaction, I went on introducing
to him &#8220;circle&#8221; after &#8220;circle&#8221; of the great
Italian&#8217;s Vision of Hell, and if Mr. Thomas Brockwell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
ever knew a genuinely happy afternoon, <i>that</i> was
the one. And when I got a soft pencil and made black
lines about the inside of his shaving-mug to illustrate
the idea of the &#8220;circle,&#8221; he eagerly peered in with his
nearly-closed, discolored eyes and triumphantly cried:
&#8220;And the old, burning-brimstone lake right at the
bottom&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>All the punishments had met with his hearty approval
save one. That great, black, &#8220;windy horror,&#8221; through
which unfortunate lovers beat their blind way&mdash;seeking,
eternally seeking their sinful mates&mdash;met with instant
condemnation. &#8220;If they had sinned&mdash;they had broken
a very important law&mdash;a law, mind you, that Moses had
received direct from Heaven. Just flying round in the
dark was no punishment for such a sin! They got
worse than that when they were alive!&#8221; For, you see,
the old man was very material, and he failed to imagine
the anguish of that &#8220;eternal, loving, despairing search!&#8221;</p>

<p>All went well. Old Brockwell not only kept to his
bed, but enjoyed himself until night and time for family
service arrived, and then the &#8220;snag&#8221; appeared in my
way that I should have seen from the first. Suddenly
suspicious, he placed his hand on the book and asked:
&#8220;Just in what part of &#8216;this&#8217; did you find all that new
&#8216;Hell&#8217; you&#8217;ve been telling me about, lass?&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat stupidly silent. I had a vision of myself being
driven away as unworthy to enter in with true believers,
having jested upon the great subject. I tried to force
my lips to speak, to tell him I would bring the book I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
had read it all in&mdash;but, truth to tell, I was too frightened
to speak, and his brow blackening with anger,
Mattie, his step-daughter, calmly asked: &#8220;Mother
where was it in the old-world they found those &#8216;sacred&#8217;
manuscripts the other day?&#8221; (Poor Emily wasn&#8217;t at
all sure there was an old-world.) &#8220;Mr. Brockwell, you&#8217;ll
know&mdash;Egypt wasn&#8217;t it? Those wise men are working
over them, you know, to translate them; they say they
are parts of the old&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Egypt,&#8221; declared the battered Brockwell. &#8220;Egypt,
and very interesting they are too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I meekly started, &#8220;but&#8221;&mdash;then Mattie cleared
her throat loudly, and bending over me, muttered:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool&mdash;leave well-enough alone!&#8221; and I followed
her advice and was silent. A month later, I told
them &#8220;good-bye,&#8221; my profession taking me far from
them, and I could not help admiring the upright, powerful
figure of the old man, as he stood at his gate&mdash;so
perfectly proportioned that it was hard to believe that
he was inches over six feet in height. As I reached
the walk I looked back. Emily, large and buxom, stood
in the door, a soft, red shawl about her ample shoulders&mdash;her
jaws working with a slow precision that told me
plainly she was &#8220;breaking in&#8221; a new piece of gum.
Bull Brockwell waved his hat to me, and, against the
westering sun, he loomed up black and big! And I
said to myself: &#8220;In faith as in body&mdash;a giant!&#8221;</p>

<p>Three years had passed before I saw him again, three
vivid, crowded years for me! Success had perched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
upon the lonely, little banner I had carried into that
strange campaign where each one fights according to
his own individual plan, and I was back in the old
city, and because of that success was in great haste to
seek my lowly, old friends out&mdash;for self respect, even a
suspicious pride, renders it very hard for the lowly to
make the first advance toward one who has risen ever
so slightly. I had heard nothing of them during my
absence, and standing at the door waiting a good, long
wait&mdash;for Emily, like most large bodies, moved slowly&mdash;I
said to myself: &#8220;I shall not see the dear, old &#8216;Bull&#8217;
for a couple of hours yet, as he will surely be sleeping
now, but by six o&#8217;clock&mdash;&#8221; and then the door opened,
and Mrs. Emily was before me, quite unchanged&mdash;and
had taken me into a big comfortable embrace&mdash;and
kissed me warmly and loudly, and expressed her gratification
so noisily that I wondered she was not afraid of
waking her husband&mdash;and then she led the way to the
sitting-room, without one word of warning or explanation&mdash;which
was so like Emily&mdash;and crying out, &#8220;My, Mr.
Brockwell, but here <i>is</i> some one you&#8217;ll be glad to see,&#8221;
she moved aside and left me in the doorway, where I
stood quite still, the smile of welcome drying stiffly on
my lips, while with pained astonishment I stared at&mdash;Mr.
Brockwell (?)&mdash;oh, yes; that thick thatch of hair was
neither whiter nor thinner than before. There was the
splendid, old torso with all its depth of chest and breadth
of shoulder. But why was he in that dread wheel-chair?
Why were his great limbs covered with a quilt?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and, worst of all, why that strange expression in his
face? Meeting that piteous, appealing glance, I felt the
tears begin to fall, for I realized that in spite of the
presence here of Mr. Brockwell&mdash;old Bull Brockwell
was no more! The painful silence was broken by the
trembling voice of Emily: &#8220;Father, I clean forgot to
tell her&mdash;anything&mdash;and&mdash;and, I declare, she does take
it right hard&mdash;don&#8217;t she, now?&#8221; and she slipped out of
the room, wiping her own eyes furtively as she went!</p>

<p>As I crossed the room toward him, his chin sank
upon his breast, and shaking his old head slowly, he
sadly murmured: &#8220;From him that <i>hath not</i>, shall be
taken away even that which he <i>hath</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>I took his great hand between both of mine, and my
lips were just forming the words: &#8220;Surely this is but
temporary?&#8221; when he raised his eyes, and, looking
into them, I saw that hope was dead and buried there.
I sank upon my knees beside him and said: &#8220;Tell me
about it, Mr. Brockwell.&#8221; He glanced towards his
wife&#8217;s room, but I persisted gently: &#8220;No&mdash;I want you
to tell me,&#8221; for my true sympathy had bridged the
years between us, and we were like old friends.</p>

<p>In low tones he told his simple, commonplace story.
It was the construction he put upon the usual that
made it seem unusual, and brief and simple as his story
was, it was intensely characteristic. He had started
earlier than usual to his night&#8217;s work, and was swinging
his coffee-pail to the measure of the old hymn,
&#8220;On Jordan&#8217;s Stormy Banks I Stand,&#8221; when, turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
into a cross-street, he found himself in a crowd of running
men and women, and in a few moments was in
the midst of all the turmoil and commotion attending
a fire, and he soon saw there was cause for the cries of
the women and the curses of the men. There had
been a nasty accident, and it had come to the first
engine approaching the fire. It had been a case of
strange driver and a too-short turn, and there, in a terrible
heap, lay one horse flat, the other on its knees,
and behind them a partly overturned engine. Worst
of all, not only were its own services lost, but it was
keeping other engines from entering the street, save by
a long detour. Now, if ever there was a demand for
lifting-power that demand was made right there, and
old Brockwell sat down his coffee-pail and began to
remove his heavy coat (it was early November then),
when he learned quite suddenly that the burning house
was a haunt of evil doers, was in fact a place that honest
folk turned their faces from as they passed, and for
the moment he hesitated, then flinging his coat fiercely
off, he shouted: &#8220;Help! men, help! That fire <i>must</i>
be quenched, to give those people one last chance to
save themselves from eternal fire,&#8221; and the &#8220;old Bull&#8221;
was with the firemen, working with a will and showing
such splendid lifting-power that the crowd cheered
the &#8220;gray old Hercules&#8221; lustily, and among other
happenings some &#8220;company&#8217;s hose&#8221; had burst, and
many were wetted thoroughly, among them old Brockwell.
A church clock had boomed out the hour, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
it was time for him to go on to his work, and then he
felt how wet he was. He might have gone home and
changed his clothing and only have been a little late
in getting to the store. There was no one to make
comment or to report his action, but he would be late,
and he was proud, (the old man&#8217;s lips had twisted painfully
in uttering that word), proud of his punctuality,
and&mdash;well&mdash;he had gone on to the store, wet as he was,
and the night had been long, and now and then, strange,
deep, burning pains, that seemed a mile long, had run
from hip to heel, but he had watched the night out&mdash;and&mdash;and
he would never watch again&mdash;that was all. He
had, in fact, &#8220;scuttled his own ship,&#8221; but in ignorance,
lass! In ignorance, not in villainy. Yes, it was
rheumatism first. He hadn&#8217;t minded that so very
much, because he had the awful pain to fight, but <i>this</i>
(again that piteous twist of the lips), <i>this</i> partial paralysis&mdash;well
there was nothing even to fight now.</p>

<p>Had I not seen hope dead in his eye? His head
sank low on his breast. I touched my lips to his hand,
and whispered, &#8220;How you have suffered!&#8221; His eyes
closed wearily, and he answered lowly: &#8220;I have eaten
ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,&#8221;
then, almost with a sob, he said: &#8220;Aye, aye&mdash;in very
truth my sin hath found me out!&#8221;</p>

<p>I started almost angrily, exclaiming: &#8220;Your sin?
What sin? You have loved&mdash;at least you have feared
God all your life long! His word has ever been upon
your lips. You have striven to obey His laws&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
sin has found you out?&#8221; He raised his head, crying:
&#8220;And to think I was so blind&mdash;so self-satisfied! To
think how I tried to keep the boys from going to perdition
by way of Sunday ball, and the girls by way of
their vanity in their bits of ribbons! The blind &#8216;leading
the blind,&#8217; in good truth! Even when I was
stricken I did not understand, until a neighbor made
my sin plain to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and had that neighbor removed the
beam from his own eye, that he could see so very
plainly the mote in yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but he said that
pride went before a fall. And when I looked a bit
surprised he added, &#8216;you have been eaten up with
vanity and puffed up with pride all your life, because
of your great strength,&#8217; and oh, lass! lass! I was
sore ashamed! Ah, well, I have no strength to sin
with now&mdash;I am just naught but a useless, old hulk, or
what is worse, &#8216;a derelict!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said, &#8220;a &#8216;derelict&#8217; is a menace and a
floating danger to many men&mdash;you are no derelict!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he, shaking his clenched hand above his head
in impotent sorrow, went on: &#8220;Worse! I&#8217;m worse
than a danger to men! Men are strong and can save
themselves, but here I hang like a mill-stone about the
neck of that poor woman there&mdash;my wife, and she&#8217;ll
have to bear the dragging and the weight for years
and years. For, mind you, I&#8217;m not like to die. The
doctors say these things inside of me that they call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
&#8216;organs&#8217; are all sound and strong, and that a man
lives <i>by them</i>, not his legs, and so I&#8217;m to sit here rusting
away, and watching her grow sick at the sight of
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Two slow, difficult tears stood chill and unshed in his
eyes, and I felt, with a pang, how great must be the
storm of sorrow that could cast its spray into those
stern, old eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that she realizes
it yet; she&#8217;s good as gold. She takes care of me,
helpless as I am, always just as smiling and pleasant,
and sets right by me, and don&#8217;t even go to church&mdash;just
talks a little over the fence with the neighbors, so she
can come and tell me what&#8217;s going on. Why, she even
offered to give up gum, and she a needing it for her
digestion so, &#8217;cause she thought it might make me restless-like
(and there is a kind of gum, you know, that
squeaks a good deal when it&#8217;s new); but I ain&#8217;t so selfish
as all that. But, oh, if I could just die decently, as a
man should when he&#8217;s no more use, and not be a burden
and a drag! For, you see, Emily&#8217;s a mighty fine
figure of a woman, and she might easily find a new
home, with some good, sound man for a husband&mdash;who
would protect her, and not sit, as I do, waiting for the
day to come when his wife will look at him with
loathing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Brockwell,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;do you know that you
are cruel to yourself and unjust to your wife?&#8221; He
looked hard at me, but made no answer. &#8220;Your wife<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
was always proud of you!&#8221; His face quivered&mdash;I had
struck a wrong note&mdash;I hurried on: &#8220;proud of your
character and standing, and of the pretty, little home
you had so hardly earned, and now, oh, believe me, dear
old friend, I know her heart better than you do yet&mdash;now
she is proud to be the world for you, to be your
feet, your nurse, your companion, your friend as well as
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sadly shook his head: &#8220;She is a slave,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Yes, if you will, she is a slave to her love for you,
therefore she is a happy slave. You have said, yourself,
that she smiles on you constantly. She never looked
better in her life, and why does she call you &#8216;father&#8217;
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>His face brightened a little. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;she has called me &#8216;father&#8217; ever since the&mdash;the&mdash;(how
he shrank from the word) since the paralysis came upon
me&mdash;yes, ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;can&#8217;t you see what that means?
She used to call you Mr. Brockwell&mdash;but when your cruel
affliction came upon you she felt the absolute need of
some term of endearment, because she loved you.&#8221; Still,
with the perversity of unhappiness, he exclaimed: &#8220;But
Emily didn&#8217;t say that. She never told me that she&mdash;she&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed,&#8221; I broke in, &#8220;and have you given her
a chance to tell you? Have you ever asked her if she
loved you still?&#8221; And the old man, with a mind
full of clean and wholesome memories, blushed at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
question with a swift swirl of color in his cheeks
that a girl of eighteen might have envied. &#8220;Have
you?&#8221; I persisted. &#8220;Come, now, let us have a little
fair play. You know she can&#8217;t speak first. You know
that, like every other modest, self-respecting woman,
she must be dumb about her feelings&mdash;her emotions,
until the man breaks the silence. You know she has
been trained to silence from her earliest girlhood. Yet,
knowing all that, you gnaw your heart in bitterness,
because she does not dare lay her arms about your neck
and assure you of her faithful love.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes glowed, his great hands opened and shut
nervously. He stammered and stumbled over his few
words: &#8220;You think I haven&#8217;t steered a straight course
with Emily, eh? You actually believe, if I take a
new tack, eh?&mdash;if I tell her how I&mdash;how,&mdash;well, how
things are with me&mdash;that she&#8217;ll come around to the
helm&mdash;I mean&mdash;&#8221; and then suddenly his face fell and,
shaking his fist in impotent rage at his helpless limbs,
he cried: &#8220;Oh, she can&#8217;t, she can&#8217;t! Look at the
miserable &#8216;old hulk,&#8217; just rottin&#8217; slowly away between
the tides of Time and Eternity, and talk of a woman
lovin&#8217; it&mdash;a-a-h!&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw Emily&#8217;s troubled face at the door and swiftly
waved her away. Then I said, as brightly as I could:
&#8220;Well, all &#8216;hulks&#8217; are not despised! I saw a real one
a few weeks ago!&#8221; He looked up quickly. &#8220;Where?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the sea,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;What kind of a hulk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
was it&mdash;some unfinished failure of a &#8216;tub,&#8217; I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a wreck! A great, gaunt-ribbed thing; stately
even in its ruin. The waves&mdash;&#8221; He caught my dress as
I rose to my feet. &#8220;Tell me about the &#8216;hulk,&#8217;
lass, tell me!&#8221; He pleaded just as a child pleads for a
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, but you must let
me go to the spare room to lay off my hat. I&#8217;m going
to stay all night, if your wife will let me!&#8221; I laughed
at his request &#8220;for me to hurry,&#8221; and said: &#8220;Mr.
Brockwell, before I go, I want to say just one more
word about your wife. <i>You</i> may doubt, but I am certain,
<i>certain</i>, that should you have your cruel wish and die
to-morrow, and should Emily be spared for many, many
years to come, at the very end she will lie at your side,
and will carry your name to her grave&#8221;; and as I passed
Emily I whispered eagerly: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry with me;
I&#8217;ll explain later, but, for God&#8217;s sake, go straight to
your husband and kiss him!&#8221; The tears rushed into
her eyes&mdash;she nodded her head and passed into the room
where he sat.</p>

<p>I loitered long over the removal of my hat and
wrap; I even waited to bathe my reddened eyes, and
then, as I slowly descended the tiny staircase, Emily&#8217;s
voice, mildly indignant, came up to me, crying, &#8220;Oh,
father, how could you, how could you?&#8221; and from the
deep, bass rumble that followed there escaped these
words: &#8220;A mighty fine figure of a woman, Emily!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>Then I sneezed loudly and entered the room to find
them discussing the rival merits of &#8220;beaten&#8221; and
&#8220;raised&#8221; biscuit, one of which we were to have for &#8220;tea.&#8221;
Mrs. Brockwell, being of a slow and peaceful nature,
naturally preferred &#8220;raised&#8221; biscuit, but Mr. Brockwell,
being more aggressive, took a great interest in
the &#8220;beating&#8221; process. Once he asked, indeed, if <i>he</i>
might not beat the dough, and Emily delightedly
assented, putting a big, white apron about him and
bringing everything close to his chair. But the poor, old
giant&#8217;s second blow had split the bread-board, and that
had been the end of biscuit-beating for him. While
Emily was pounding vigorously, if somewhat slowly,
at her dough, I told my old friend of that other hulk,
bleached white as chalk by the blazing sun, lying high
upon the beach, listing over so that it made a sort of
shelter for people to sit under, with the fine, pale sand
slowly filling it&mdash;slowly piling up about it; how, when
I saw it, the ocean which had cast it there was
stretched out waveless beneath the sun, with only a
slow, deep, regular heave, that was like the breathing
of some mighty monster at rest. I told him of that
awful night when the signals of distress were sent up
into the pitiless sky, and were seen and heard by helpless,
distracted men and women on shore; and how, in
the gray morning, they were astounded to see the big
ship high upon the beach, and dumbfounded when
they saw she was a coffin, for there was the body
of a woman there. Slight and young and small of foot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
and hand, and a Catholic, since a &#8220;scapula&#8221; was
about her neck&mdash;and that was all. How the young
stranger had been buried on the high land overlooking
the sea and the wreck, and how, down below and up
above, both were waiting, one for utter destruction, the
other, for a glorious resurrection; and meantime the
old hulk had become not only a landmark, but a thing
beloved. Oh, yes; he need not shake his head, for
that old hulk was the loyal friend of all true lovers. The
great, gray, maimed thing sheltered many a shrinking pair
from prying eyes. Brown, young rustics, who were fairly
stricken dumb in the &#8220;sittin&#8217;-rooms&#8221; of their sweethearts,
here, in the velvety, black shadow of the friendly, old
hulk, found their tongues, and told swiftly and well the
one old story that is ever new; while, as to summer
nights&mdash;why, the old hulk was the trysting-place of
lovers from half the countryside. It was so public,
and yet so sheltered&mdash;so protecting. And it was so
wise, the gray, old, sand-filled thing&mdash;it knew so much
of Love, and Love&#8217;s dear brother, Death!&mdash;so much&mdash;good
God, so much! and yet was silent&mdash;ever silent!</p>

<p>Half the young married women of the little town
had received their engagement rings within the sheltering
arms of the old hulk, and some of them had carried
their little children there, later on, that they might
take their first, uncertain steps upon the soft, pale
sands that were drifting ever higher about the bleaching
wreck, just as one might take the first spring blossoms
to some spot that was sacred to us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>That noble ship that on even keel, with mighty spread
of snowy canvas, had sat the water a living thing of
strength and beauty, had had a commercial value only,
but wrecked, it had become a precious thing to them all,
garlanded with the tenderest sentiments of both men and
women, draped with the radiant hopes of youth, and each
day gilded anew with ever-living love. As it sank deeper
in the sand, so it sank deeper in their memories&mdash;their
beloved &#8220;old hulk&#8221;!</p>

<p>The old man had listened so closely to my story that I
was somewhat puzzled when he remarked on my last
word: &#8220;If I was sure and certain that Emily was telling
the truth about that patch-work, I don&#8217;t know but what I
might get to be more that sort of hulk myself, lass! If
I could just be of a little use&mdash;ever so little, but real!&mdash;I
could get along, but I don&#8217;t want to be fooled, like
a child, into doing <i>useless</i> things. The Lord says: &#8216;A
man should rejoice in his work!&#8217; but a man can&#8217;t
rejoice if it&#8217;s only make-believe work!&#8221;</p>

<p>I began dimly to comprehend, and, proceeding cautiously,
I remarked &#8220;that it would not be easy to
deceive him, and I did not believe anyone would try!&#8221;
He looked doubtful and, lowering his voice so that his
wife might not hear him, asked: &#8220;You know what a
master hand Emily is at piecing patch-work, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I did know! I recalled the really handsome quilts
she had shown me. It was the only way she had to
gratify her natural love of color, and the workmanship
was exquisite. The quilting in &#8220;fan&#8221; and &#8220;shell&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and &#8220;diamond&#8221; forms equalling the piecing. Indeed,
patch-work was a fine art in Mrs. Brockwell&#8217;s hands.
&#8220;Yes, I knew!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then his keen, old, blue eyes took fast hold upon mine
and, in an aggressive tone, he made this astonishing statement:
&#8220;Well, Emily can&#8217;t cut out any of her patch-work
herself. She can&#8217;t cut any two pieces exactly alike,
to save her life!&#8221; Oh, Emily, Emily! poor, bungling, loving
Sapphira! I understood and thought fast while those
piercing, old eyes held me! I tried to laugh naturally,
as I exclaimed: &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a pair of us, then! I
have lovely pieces&mdash;enough for two quilts, but I can&#8217;t
cut pieces alike, and am ashamed to ask anyone to do
it for me; so there they lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you!&#8221; he impatiently answered, &#8220;but Emily,
now!&#8221; I thought of those quilts upstairs, while he went
on: &#8220;See this thing, now!&#8221; He pointed to the small
quilt over his knees. I required no invitation, goodness
knows! for the ugly, ill-made thing had forced my
attention long ago. No two pieces matched in length;
they were puckered and stretched (the old man called
them &#8220;we-wahed&#8221;).</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s <i>her</i> cutting,&#8221; he announced! I was about to
explain, when I saw Emily behind him in the kitchen-door
frantically signing me to keep quiet. &#8220;Oh,
dear!&#8221; I moaned to myself, &#8220;what about those quilts
upstairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes;&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s cuttin&#8217; out!
Yes (argumentatively), I saw her do it! And think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
of those quilts upstairs! (Ah, I thought!) Why,
Emily says she would have had enough for herself and
for her daughters&#8217; marrying, if she could have got
her first husband to cut her pieces for her! (O,
Emily!) but she had to beg and beg, and he wouldn&#8217;t
cut a single piece for a whole year sometimes. She
says he was ashamed to do it, she reckons! Well!&#8221; he
hotly ejaculated, &#8220;I&#8217;m not ashamed to do <i>anything</i>
for <i>my</i> wife, unless&#8221;&mdash;he cooled suddenly again&mdash;&#8220;unless
she&#8217;s only making believe so as to give me
employment!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;if you choose to doubt your wife,
after looking at that awful quilt, you may. But you
can&#8217;t well suspect <i>me</i>, and if you will cut pieces for one
quilt for me I&#8217;ll give you silk enough for a quilt for
yourself. Will you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The last suspicion faded! He threw back his head
and laughed: &#8220;Will I? You&#8217;ll see! Say, lass, just step
over to the sta&#8217;board side of that sewing machine and
hand me up that cuttin&#8217; board, and I&#8217;ll show you what&#8217;s
the matter with the &#8216;cuttin&#8217; out&#8217; of all you women.
You see,&#8221;&mdash;he spoke with an air of growing authority
as he unrolled some bits of calico&mdash;&#8220;you will just
have your pattern cut out of a bit of cotton
or delaine, and then you smack that down onto,
perhaps, <i>several pieces</i> of goods together, never
mind whether bias or straight, just to save time.
Great guns! save time! Look at <i>that</i> thing over my
knees! Well, <i>I</i> take the &#8216;sun observation,&#8217; and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
get my pattern all right, and <i>then</i> I cuts her out in
good, stiff pasteboard, ma&#8217;am, and if it&#8217;s a hard pattern,
like &#8216;bride in the mist&#8217; or &#8216;the risin&#8217; sun,&#8217; I have the
thing cut out of a thin sheet of tin. A&mdash;a&mdash;ho! I don&#8217;t
make no mistakes, even with &#8216;brides in the mist,&#8217; when
I&#8217;ve a good, tin pattern to work by!&#8221;</p>

<p>As so often happens, enthusiasm was too much for
his grammar. He talked and planned all through tea
and right along to bed time, and I carried the big Bible
to him and placed it open upon his lap. His hand
instinctively began to turn the leaves in the front of the
volume, but I rested my hand on the place I had
selected, and, laughing, I said: &#8220;You have chosen for
three whole years, <i>I&#8217;m company</i> to-night, and you must
let me choose!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed a little and yielded, but when he saw
my choice was from the New Testament, he frowned
heavily, then cleared his brow as with an effort and
read. He was not so familiar with the script as usual,
and he read slowly and carefully, and when he came to
that gentle, generous invitation and that all-comprehending
promise, &#8220;Come to me <i>all ye</i>&mdash;<i>all ye</i>&mdash;who
are weary and heavy laden&mdash;and I will give you rest!&#8221;
he stopped! To this day I believe I felt the old
man&#8217;s thought, which was of the astounding comprehension
by Jesus of his one craving wish&mdash;not
for great joy&mdash;not for the inheritance of the earth&mdash;no,
not for anything but that which was promised:
&#8220;<i>Rest</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>&#8220;Come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy
laden, and I will give you rest!&#8221; Slowly, with trembling
lips, he repeated the words a second time. Then
he leant forward, tore a bit from the evening paper, and
placing it as a marker, he closed the book. Emily and
I knelt, and for once I felt no sense of the ridiculous
in hearing a poor, finite creature explaining matters to
the Infinite Being who knows all things. Very humbly
the old believer explained to the God he had made
so fearsome to himself why he lifted his voice in prayer
in this unseemly attitude, instead of on his knees in
humble, <i>loving</i> humility!</p>

<p>I gasped&mdash;I felt Emily&#8217;s hand slip over and grasp
mine&mdash;which proved lucky later on. Never before had
that word been heard in that way, in this house of faith.
But, oh, when the old man asked forgiveness for having
wickedly doubted for a time the perfect truthfulness of
one very near to him&mdash;his truest friend&mdash;Emily gave a
plunge and tried to pull away from me. &#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221;
she gasped. &#8220;I can&#8217;t bear it! I must confess my lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; I moaned under cover of his bass rumble,
&#8220;keep still! He&#8217;s so happy now! Confess to heaven!&#8221;
She tried again to pull her hand away. I clung tight,
and putting my lips close to her ear, whispered: &#8220;<i>He</i>
will forgive you because of your love! You know,&#8221;
I muttered wildly, &#8220;much shall be forgiven because she
loved much! That&#8217;s not it, but you know what I mean!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bass rumble stopped suddenly&mdash;so did I&mdash;but
thank heaven, Emily&#8217;s spurt of remorseful courage was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
over&mdash;her loving falsehood unconfessed! The rumble
was resumed, and all was well!</p>

<p>Next day, as I came in hatted and cloaked to say
&#8220;good-bye,&#8221; old Brockwell&mdash;bright and ruddy&mdash;had his
cutting board on his knees, bits of calico all over him.
A foot-rule, a blue pencil, and several envelopes before
him, and the air of &#8220;this is my busy day&#8221; of a railroad
magnate at least. His &#8220;log-cabin&#8221; pattern had
been found in a &#8220;rocky-mountain&#8221; envelope, and in
fact things were all at loggerheads&mdash;but by-and-by
they would be ship-shape. I was just to wait till I saw
some of his <i>own</i> designs! Emily was going to go right
<i>at</i> one&mdash;of &#8220;anchors&#8221;&mdash;blue anchors on a white ground,
and did I suppose any of my pieces would be long
enough&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t well have those anchors less than
six or seven inches long, and then a bit of the old
Adam came out in him, when he lowered his voice to
tell me: &#8220;<i>He</i> was not ashamed to cut patch-work, and
he was not afraid&mdash;that in a year from now there would
be quilts <i>downstairs</i> that could outsail anything upstairs
that had been cut out only after beggin&#8217; and
coaxin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at the mighty wreck before me! I thought
of the three men he had put out in that early morning
fight! Of how, strained and patched and stitched, he
had picked up that barrel of flour and carried it in
from very pride in his strength! How he had won
cheers for his splendid lifting-power at that fire, and
now he had come to <i>this</i>! He sat there helpless as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
child, his only work cutting up scraps of calico for
quilts. He was, as he himself said, &#8220;an old hulk!&#8221;
and yet he looked brightly up to me and said: &#8220;You
remember old lady Brighton, don&#8217;t you, lass? Unbeliever,
poor old thing! Emily and I are going to make
a real pretty &#8216;star quilt&#8217; and give to her. Star-pattern
works up such small pieces, you know! Nothing,
most, too small for that, and so bright too!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was no use denying it&mdash;this wreck <i>was</i> dearer&mdash;was
more valuable to others, <i>as</i> a wreck, than it had
been in full panoply and strength. He was accepting
things&mdash;he was conquering himself, and he was &#8220;greater
than he who taketh a city!&#8221;</p>

<p>So there I left him. For background, he had his
honest, toilsome, clean-thinking past! His old wife&#8217;s
faithful love was as the blue sky, bowing gently over
him. The slow, still sands of Time piling steadily
about him, and before him that great, illimitable ocean
of Eternity, which will at last receive into its bosom
this fine, old hulk!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Gentleman Who Was Going to Die</h2>
</div>


<p>Of course he had a name, and we both knew it, yet
we invariably spoke of him not as Clarks nor as Mr.
Clarks, but as &#8220;the gentleman who was going to die.&#8221;
We must have been a troublesome pair of &#8220;little pitchers&#8221;
to have about, with our widely open ears, in such
a place and at such a time; and I remember quite well
that our elders were much annoyed when they found
that we knew that &#8220;the gentleman was going to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was three years older than my companion, and
very, very serious; indeed, he was the only child who
ever made me enjoy a game of romps. Pretty, golden-haired,
laughing little fellow, no one ever resisted him.
He passed through his short life a baby Prince Charming,
a little, conquering hero.</p>

<p>His father was the Sheriff of the city, and, for the
time being, the Sheriff&#8217;s family lived in that portion of
the jail reserved for home life; and my mother was
paying a long visit to the Sheriff&#8217;s wife. That&#8217;s how
it happened that two young children were living within
those sullen walls, taking their exercise in its grim
corridors and playing their games within the very
shadow of the scaffold.</p>

<p>In pleasant weather we used to play out in the jail-yard;
it was small, but not so closed in as it now is by
the Court-house. At that time the court stood over
in the Park, or Public Square, as it was called. Out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
there we played &#8220;escaping prisoner.&#8221; I, as the Sheriff,
had to run down and bring back little Goldy-locks
(Charley was his real name) as prisoner. He was very
realistic in his struggles for freedom, as certain, big, blue
marks on my arms used to testify; but whenever he saw
them he would put penitent little lips to them and tell
me reassuringly not to mind, &#8220;cause he would play
Sheriff to-morrow and I cud &#8217;scape,&#8221; in which case I
knew he would have nearly pounded the life out of
me, so I very much preferred to keep my part of
Sheriff.</p>

<p>In other weather, and it was mostly &#8220;other&#8221; weather,
we sought the corridors of the jail. The dwelling-rooms
were small and crowded, and, besides, the big people
were all the time &#8220;don&#8217;ting&#8221; us&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t do this&#8221; and
&#8220;don&#8217;t do that&#8221;&mdash;so Charley would rumple his curls
with a small, impatient hand, look very cross for a
moment, then come and whisper, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to jail,&#8221;
and straight we went in search of the turnkey, who was
Charley&#8217;s uncle as well as slave, and he would put a key
into a great lock and we would push at the big, heavy
door. Then in we would tumble, and the door would
be closed behind us, unless some of the prisoners&#8217; cells
were open. In that case the turnkey remained inside
the corridor with us, but that was unusual.</p>

<p>The first thing we always did was to run to each cell
and peer in to see if anyone was lying down. No one
had ever made the suggestion to us, but of our own
accord we had made it a point of honor never to make a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
noise there if we found anyone who remained on his cot
after our arrival. Generally every one sprang up and
came to the barred doors to greet us, always with nice
words, sometimes with very gentle ones. Often they
would lay wagers on the result of our games. We used
to play &#8220;tag&#8221; and &#8220;blind man&#8217;s buff,&#8221; and we played
&#8220;puss-in-the-corner&#8221; by counting every other cell door
a corner.</p>

<p>That corridor had two great attractions for us. One
was that the late afternoon sunlight fell through the
barred window at its end. The other was that &#8220;the
gentleman who was going to die&#8221; had his cell there,
and Charley loved him, while I was filled with terror,
dread and pity by the sight of him. There were three
long, troubled years between Goldy-locks and me, and I
knew dreadful things about Charley&#8217;s friend, things I
dared not tell him.</p>

<p>With every human being in or about the jail the boy
was the pet, the favorite with one single exception&mdash;&#8220;the
gentleman who was going to die.&#8221; He favored me
almost to the point of adoration, no one guessing why
till he himself explained the mystery.</p>

<p>My heavy, brown braids and solemn, saucer eyes
seemed to blind him utterly to the touching beauty of
Goldy-locks, and when we stood before his cell door
while he told wonderful stories, selected especially to
suit the boy&#8217;s taste, his eyes were on my face, his
fingers held a bit of my little, white apron, or he drew
one of my long braids between the crossed bars of his door<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
and stroked and kissed it. Though at that time I loved
the stories and liked him, I could never quite make up
my mind to kiss him, and Charley used to be angry
about it, and once he told me &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t dratefu&#8217;, not
one we&#8217;est bit on earf, not to kiss dear &#8216;Mr. No. 3&#8217;&#8221;;
that&#8217;s what we always called him before we knew he was
going to die&mdash;three being the number of the cell in which
he was confined.</p>

<p>When I first learned that Mr. Clarks was going to
surely die, on a certain positively named day, I was utterly
amazed to find that, instead of being frightened and
sorry and sending for doctors, everybody seemed to be
pleased&mdash;that is, everybody out in the streets and in the
stores and markets, and being an active, &#8220;two-legged
why,&#8221; I sought information and obtained it in that form
known to man as &#8220;straight.&#8221; He to whom I had applied
was a very young man, who knew no reason why a child
should be spared such horrible knowledge, and so, with
brutal frankness and ample detail, he had explained
exactly why Charles Clarks was going to die.</p>

<p>It was the first tale of crime that had been poured
into my shrinking, childish ears, and it gave me a distinct
shock. I was quite feverish by evening and had
to have wet cloths applied to my burning head, while
during the night I cried out again and again about the
&#8220;lightning and the knife,&#8221; and the next day found me
white and miserable, with only one strong wish, and
that was to keep away from &#8220;the gentleman who was
going to die.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>It was so hard to associate the man with the bright,
blue eyes, the manly voice, the gentle hands&mdash;ugh!
those hands!&mdash;with that wretch who had hacked the life
out of a fellow creature for a sum of money. It seems
curious, but the actual taking of the man&#8217;s life had not
near the power to torture and torment me that this complete
ignoring of a certain sentiment had. The victim
had been a fellow-countryman who was unutterably
homesick, and whose joy was boundless when he met a
friend from the dear, old English home. I would moan
aloud when I thought of the awful surprise and horror
the man must have felt when he received the first knife-thrust
in his breast from the hand of a brother-Englishman
in a strange land. Then the shocking details that
followed the death! The crime was committed at night
during a memorable storm. The body lay upon a railroad
bridge; the victim&#8217;s identity must be destroyed!
The murderer attempted to remove the head; he had
but his big clasp-knife, and it was not strong and sharp
enough to sever the bone in the neck. He would have
to leave the bridge to find a stone to serve as a hammer
in this frightful deed! But in that inky darkness how
was he to find his way back? He could only wait for
the dazzling glare of God&#8217;s great flashlight, the lightning;
and so with unshaken nerves, bit by bit he worked
his unhallowed will. He found the stone and crammed
it into his pocket (the other held the dead man&#8217;s
effects); the knife he carried between his teeth. The
mighty wind so tore at him that on the bridge he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
to creep upon his hands and knees. He hacked off the
head and tied it in a silk neckerchief, and no man
knows more unto this day. The stream was dragged,
trees chopped down, open ground carefully plowed, all
in vain. The head was never found.</p>

<p>With devilish mirth the murderer would sometimes
offer to find the head. &#8220;Leave me my hands free and
send but two men, your bravest, strongest picked men
to guard me, and I will send you back the head&mdash;I
swear it!&#8221; he would say; and to the Sheriff&#8217;s smiling
question, &#8220;And you? You say &#8216;send,&#8217; not &#8216;bring.&#8217;
Would you not bring the head back?&#8221; he would reply,
&#8220;Oh, I say now, you don&#8217;t think me quite a fool, do
you?&#8221; and though he would laugh heartily enough,
there would be a quickening of his breath and a hot
spark away back in his eye not very pleasant nor by
any means reassuring to the man who was responsible
for his safe keeping.</p>

<p>Two days after I had picked this bitter fruit from
the tree of knowledge I found myself, under the orders
of my yellow-haired, little tyrant, slowly and unwillingly
entering the jail corridor again. Holding me by the
hand, he pulled me past the turnkey and made straight
for the dreaded cell. At our entrance various greetings
reached us: &#8220;Hello, babies!&#8221; &#8220;How are you,
little ones?&#8221; &#8220;Come up here, youngster, where I can
see you!&#8221; while the man with the cough called
out, &#8220;Sissy, come here and I&#8217;ll give you half of my
licorice!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>But I stood in silence, my eyes fixed upon the stone
pavement, while my little companion, trembling with
excitement, put his first, troubled, anxious question:
&#8220;Dear Mr. No. 3, are you truly a-goin&#8217; to die?&#8221;</p>

<p>The silence that came upon the occupants of the
other cells at this question might have been the silence
of death. Mr. No. 3 made a little sound like that the
grown-ups make sometimes, and afterward say: &#8220;Oh,
I had, a stitch in my side!&#8221; and then he answered,
&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;yes, my boy&mdash;we are all going to die&mdash;you
know that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Charley&#8217;s delicate brows knit themselves together
distressfully as he slowly murmured, &#8220;Yes, evweybody.
My papa is the biggest mans in this town and he&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to die, the whole of him, only, only&mdash;&#8221; suddenly his
brow cleared and he hurried on&mdash;&#8220;only he and us allis jus&#8217;
goin&#8217; to die som&#8217;time, not a &#8217;xac&#8217;ly day to know about.
Are you goin&#8217; to die in free weeks? Please don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of answering directly, he turned to me with,
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, little lass? Why don&#8217;t you
speak; are you sick, child?&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought of the lightning and the knife, and truly I
was sick, but I could not speak; I only slipped my
hand through one of the openings in the door and clung
silently to a bar. Charley turned and looked at me,
and said in his important, little way: &#8220;I dess she&#8217;s got
the aches in her head ag&#8217;in! But please, Mr. No. 3,
what&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; to be the matter wiv you, if you are
goin&#8217; to die?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>And then No. 3 laughed a laugh that made me cold,
and said, &#8220;Well, your father and some of his friends
think I am going to die of a throat trouble, but I&#8217;ll bet
five dollars they are mistaken!&#8221; and then again he
spoke quietly to me: &#8220;What is it, child; why are you
so pale?&#8221;</p>

<p>He gently took my little hand in his. I gave a
scream and tore it so roughly from him that it was
badly cut in passing the bars. I raised my face&mdash;and
I suppose some of my loathing fear and horror must
have been written there, for never shall I forget that
next moment! He was looking down straight into my
eyes, when suddenly his own flared wide open, then as
quickly narrowing to the merest, glittering slit, he gave
the most awful oath I ever heard, and angrily muttered:
&#8220;They have told her! She knows all, this little
child! Oh, how could they do it! How could
they do it! What cruel beasts men are!&#8221; And then
rang through the building one great, appalling cry, like
that of some wild beast in pain and rage. At that cry
all was wild commotion. The turnkey struck out one
peal from the alarm bell, and was tearing open the
great lock of the main door. No. 3 suddenly clenched
his soft, white hand and drove it with all his force
against the iron bars. The blood seemed to leap from
his gashed wrist and hand and fall in streams down into
his sleeve. He seized the bars of his door and shook
them as another man might have shaken a wooden
lattice. The turnkey was at the cell; was in; there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
was a scuffle of feet. The heavy, wordless breathing
of desperate men, two clear, cold-sounding clicks, and
No. 3, with white, drawn face, lifted his manacled
hands high above his head to strike a killing blow,
stopped suddenly, and pitched forward on his cot, face
downward, and as the turnkey hurried us out of the
corridor I heard that dreadful sound that wrings with
pain all there is of womanhood in any female thing,
whether she be seventy or seven years old&mdash;the sound
of a strong man&#8217;s sobs.</p>

<p>The next morning at breakfast we learned that we
were all invited to visit Charley&#8217;s grandmother in the
country, and his father was going to send us in a day
or two.</p>

<p>Little Goldy-locks raised surprised eyes and
remarked, &#8220;I fought we always made hot visits to
drandma&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now his adoring grandparent would undoubtedly
have admitted that Charley did make his visits warm
for her, but what he meant was that their visits had
always been paid at the farm in hot weather. Getting
no answer, he went on: &#8220;What&#8217;s the use, there ain&#8217;t
anything grode yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;there&#8217;s grass and
flowers, and perhaps the peach trees will be in
blossom.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little silence, then lifting his dear eyes
to his father&#8217;s face, he asked, &#8220;Papa, will it be free
weeks while we&#8217;s away?&#8221; No answer came; then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
again, &#8220;Papa, I love drandma very much, but&mdash;but&mdash;the
gentleman might die while we&#8217;s all away, and I&#8217;d
be so sorry, papa.&#8221; His little head drooped, and the
tears ran fast down his cheeks. My mother was nearest
to him, and she took him in her arms and stroked
his curly hair while exchanging looks with his mother,
and his father raised up his six-feet-two of height and
simply fled in silence from the sight of that innocent,
childish grief.</p>

<p>But I was happy&mdash;happy at the thought of getting
away from the place where &#8220;the gentleman was going
to die.&#8221; Charley was anxious to go to his friend at
once; he said he had &#8220;free whole things to tell him,
most &#8217;ticular.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he dragged me off with him, and lo! there sat a
strange man inside the corridor and right beside No.
3&#8217;s door. We would not go in while he was there, so
we went out and down to the yard together, talking
excitedly, and wondering who the strange man was.</p>

<p>There we heard, as we managed to hear everything,
that Mr. No. 3 was going to be put into another cell.
Back we went to the corridor to ask about that, and
there sat the strange man. Then Charley grew quite
angry, and, turning to his uncle, said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you give that man a cell and not have &#8217;im settin&#8217; roun&#8217;
in the way all the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>And, under cover of the shouts of laughter of the
prisoners, we retired a second time, defeated. It was
late in the afternoon when we made our third attempt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
to see &#8220;the gentleman who was going to die.&#8221; We
had little hope of success, but suddenly, to Charley&#8217;s
great joy, we saw in a big, square cell, the strange man,
with some others, trying the bars with hammers, and
we slipped past and begged the turnkey to let us into
our corridor quick. He smiled and said, &#8220;All right,
chicks; I guess this is your last chance at No. 3 without
the watch. Even his wife won&#8217;t see him alone next
time she comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we tumbled past the big door the sunlight burst
out from behind a cloud. Charley gave a shout, and
crying, &#8220;You can&#8217;t catch me &#8217;fore I touch the sunshine,&#8221;
bounded away toward the window. He was
well ahead, but I started after him, and almost in the
same instant I saw him slip and throw out his arms.
He did not trip; he slid exactly as though he had been
on the ice, and then fell heavily, face down on the stone
floor. There were many exclamations of pity as I
rushed to him, crying, &#8220;Oh, Charley, darling! are you
hurt very badly?&#8221;</p>

<p>I stooped over to help him, but instead of rising at
once, he turned slowly over and sat for a moment
on the floor and said, &#8220;What made me slip?&#8221; I only
repeated, &#8220;Are you hurt, dear?&#8221; and though his lips
quivered piteously, he bravely answered, &#8220;No; only
some places smart some, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And all the time that I was lifting him to his feet
and noting the steady spread of that cruel mark on his
face, I was conscious, coldly conscious, that at No. 3&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
door I had seen no face, from No. 3&#8217;s cell I had heard
no voice. Once again Charley lifted up his puzzled
eyes to me and said, &#8220;What made me slip?&#8221; and putting
his arm around my waist to steady himself, he
raised his right foot, and resting it on his left knee he
looked at the sole of his little slipper and it was wet.</p>

<p>I leaned over and passed my forefinger across it to
make sure, then without thought drew my finger down
my white apron and left a long red smear. The man in
the cell nearest us groaned. I gasped, &#8220;Blood!&#8221; and
Charley hid his face in my garments and trembled like
a leaf. Holding him tight with my both arms I looked
behind me, and there across the gray, stone floor, slow,
sluggish and sinister, there crept a narrow, dark-red
stream, silent, so stealthily silent, and yet in that
instant&#8217;s pause I seemed to understand the excitement
it would presently create.</p>

<p>A moment we stood a pair of terror-shaken children;
then holding Charley in my arms I rushed madly for
the corridor door. The turnkey, peacefully reading his
paper, heard us coming and said, &#8220;Not through already?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then as he turned his head his face went white as he
finished with, &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laid my hand upon the smear on my white apron
and gasped, &#8220;Blood!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was unlocking the door as he said, &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>I pointed a flickering forefinger at the slow stream
and answered, &#8220;No. 3,&#8221; and as he rushed past us he
cried, &#8220;I knew it! God! I knew it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>Before he reached the cell door he called back to me,
&#8220;Ring the bell&mdash;hard&mdash;hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>I pulled the big bell and then pandemonium broke
loose. The narrow, silent, little stream was beginning
to show its power. I hurried down the back stairs and
put Charley in the hands of a housemaid, who cared for
his hurts and put him in bed and sat by him, while I,
making myself as small as possible, crept back through
the jail corridors because I could not keep away.</p>

<p>All was excitement. The wildest rumors had already
reached the private part of the building. No one noticed
me. I crept up the stairs, and for a little while dared
go no farther. While I waited there people went and
came. One man, tall and bearded, with a black box or
case like a big book in his hand, I recognized as a doctor.</p>

<p>I softly followed the path that all had taken to No. 3&#8217;s
corridor. I stood still in the doorway for the very
excellent reason that I had lost all power of movement.
Once glance told me the little, red stream I had seen
creeping from beneath the door of cell No. 3 was gone,
the stones being still wet from their washing, while a
second one told me more washing would be required
presently. At the far end of the hall, on the floor
beneath the window, was stretched the form of &#8220;the
gentleman who was going to die.&#8221; His lower limbs
were fully clothed, but from the upper part of his body
they had cut the clothing and he was nude. At his
feet knelt two men who used all their strength in trying
to hold him down. At each shoulder knelt a man who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
grasped him by wrist and forearm, and with dripping
brows bent over him with the same purpose in view.
The doctor, on his knees, was leaning across him, while
a step away Charley&#8217;s mother stood with her face covered
with both hands, and each and every one had fearsome,
bright red stains upon them. A sudden thought came
piercing through my dulled brain, a thought that brought
me near to my undoing. I said, &#8220;Can this be justice!
Are they going to repeat here in this very jail the awful
act committed on the railroad bridge that stormy
night?&#8221; I am certain that a roll of thunder at that
moment would have killed me outright. As it was, my
eyes closed, and I had a faint feeling of wonder as to
whether I was going to fall asleep. Fortunately, I
heard certain words that dismissed the grotesque fear
and gave me back a little strength; words of advice, of
stem command, of argument, and once sobbing words
of entreaty. But through them almost continuously
there rose a sound of horror. I thought then, and I
have never changed the thought since, that it was like
the fierce growling and snapping of a mad dog.
Encouraged by the words I had heard from all, I
opened my eyes. At that same instant the doctor, with
a gesture of despair, raised himself, and I was looking
full into the awful face of Charles Clarks, murderer
and would-be suicide. He had attacked the citadel of
his life at his throat. With an almost ludicrously inadequate
weapon he had done terrific work, and had almost
carried out his purpose. He lay there now, that thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
to marvel at&mdash;a fighting Englishman brought to bay.
And I, a little, shivering child, stood there witness to
a savage struggle, awful beyond description, and gathered
up and let go of my apron with the regularity of a
mechanical toy, while in a whisper I said, and said, and
said, perhaps a thousand times&mdash;I do not know&mdash;&#8220;Oh,
our Father! Oh, our Father! Oh, our Father!&#8221; And
one man with a gashed throat and veins nearly empty
battled madly for death against six strong fellow-creatures
who fought with equal desperation to save
him! &#8220;Oh, our Father!&#8221; What a smile when he
heard the doctor say, &#8220;Chloroform could not be brought
before the light had gone.&#8221; The doctor saw, and his
face grew like stone, and he said, &#8220;He shall be held!
The wounds must be stitched at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent again to his attempted work, and instantly
the ghastly head was jerked this way and that, and
there rose again the growling and the snapping. The
doctor raised his head and said coldly, &#8220;Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;,
you must save us; you must hold his head!&#8221;</p>

<p>A cry rang through the jail, and in an instant No. 3
was still. She said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t! I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor insisted. &#8220;Your husband will be a ruined
man if this prisoner dies before his time. Kneel there!&#8221;</p>

<p>She knelt. No. 3 said, in his strange, whistling sort
of voice, &#8220;You have been good to me, but do this thing
and I will curse you here and from the Hell I&#8217;m going to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor commanded, &#8220;Put one hand here, the
other there, and hold firmly with all your strength!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
Then as five held him the sewing was accomplished,
and I turned to fly from the hurt I thought the needle
might give him, and stumbled to my mother&#8217;s bed. She
was not there; all thought I was safe by little Charley,
and I fell upon my knees and went right on muttering
&#8220;Oh, our Father!&#8221; until I began to feel very light,
and then to float, float, and the next I knew it was
morning and I was very sick, but a maid told me that
&#8220;the gentleman who was going to die&#8221; was not dead yet.</p>

<p>The attempted suicide caused the greatest confusion
and excitement both inside and outside the jail. People
were coming and going at all hours, and the grown-ups
were more than ever anxious to get us away to the country.
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; would not leave her husband at such
a time, so my mother was to take us both the next day.</p>

<p>Little Goldy-locks never gave up his intention of
seeing and saying good-bye to the gentleman who was
trying so hard to die (in his own way). So through
tears and kisses, and by bringing to bear all his graces
of body and manner, the little fellow won his way, and
just before leaving mother led us (dressed for our journey)
to the cell, and the uncle-turnkey let us in. A
nurse crossly admonished us all not to talk too much,
and then we were standing by the bed. At the first
sight of the ghastly face&mdash;the grimly bandaged throat
and jaws and brow&mdash;the little lad gave a cry of terror.
But when Mr. No. 3 said softly, &#8220;Charley!&#8221; he ran
and swarmed up the bed with legs and arms, crying,
&#8220;Oh, dear, dear Mr. No. 3! I fought it wasn&#8217;t you!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
Who hurted you? My papa will find out and he will
put the man in a cell, and we won&#8217;t never go and see
&#8217;im, never!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then being told he must not talk so loud and that he
must hurry, he said very earnestly, as he brought from
his pocket a small, red wad, &#8220;Here, Mr. No. 3, here&#8217;s
my wed stocking; I got it my ownse&#8217;f for you. If your
froat should get sore, like you said, you dess put it on
at night and you&#8217;ll come all well in the morning&mdash;dess
like I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>A smile parted the man&#8217;s white lips as he said,
&#8220;Thank you, my boy&mdash;I may try it&mdash;though I suppose&mdash;hemp
would suit&mdash;my case&mdash;better than wool.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time his eyes had gone past Charley and
were on me. My mother noticed it, and now he hurriedly
whispered &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; and as Charley was taken
down he motioned to have me lifted up into his place.
Then in a whispering voice he said to my mother,
&#8220;You think&mdash;it strange&mdash;eh, well!&mdash;it&#8217;s because she is&mdash;so
wonderfully like&mdash;my child&mdash;my only one&mdash;my
Annie. It&#8217;s marvelous&mdash;the likeness. It&#8217;s not that
they both&mdash;have that same&mdash;surprising length of hair&mdash;the
same wide, gray-blue eyes&mdash;the same tricks&mdash;of
manner and movement&mdash;even to that habit of standing&mdash;with
hands behind the back&mdash;gently pulling at the
two great braids. But it&#8217;s the voice. I&#8217;ve been ready&mdash;to
swear at times&mdash;that my wife&mdash;had broken her
vow&mdash;and had brought&mdash;Annie to see me. And though
I starve&mdash;for the sight of her&mdash;until at times I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
almost mad&mdash;I&#8217;d kill my wife&mdash;if she brought&mdash;the
child here&mdash;to know my shame. And this little one&mdash;is
so like her&mdash;so like and yet so different&mdash;for Annie
loves me&mdash;while this child&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt my face flame with hot blood, for my mother
did not know I had been told of the murder, and I was
frightened, but he went on gently, &#8220;Ah, well, there is
no reason why this one should&mdash;love me&mdash;a stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse exclaimed, &#8220;Too much talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother moved toward the door, but Charley broke
from her and once more climbed up on the bed. &#8220;I
have dess one &#8217;ticular thing to say, dess one!&#8221; he
pleaded, and he stooped to whisper to the sick man,
&#8220;Dear, dear Mr. No. 3&mdash;try to get well&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I
know you don&#8217;t like the preacher man, but I know my
own night &#8216;prays&#8217; my ownse&#8217;f, and when I say &#8216;my
soul to keep&#8217; I&#8217;ll say &#8216;your soul to keep,&#8217; too, every
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Clarks groaned, &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake take him
away!&#8221; and Goldy-locks put his clean, sweet, little
pink lips lovingly to those sin-stained, fever-parched
ones and said &#8220;Good-bye, good-bye!&#8221; and slid down and
ran and hid his tears in the folds of my mother&#8217;s dress.</p>

<p>I moved to leave the bed, but he laid a detaining
hand lightly upon me. I shivered, and looking up I
met his gaze and was held by it. It was pleading&mdash;commanding,
almost compelling. I understood him
perfectly, and I tried hard to break away from that
controlling glance, but all in vain, until a dimness came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
across his eyes and slow tears gathered there. Then I
wrenched my eyes from his and hung my head and
whispered, &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221; As my mother called me I
slid off the bed to go to her, but the hoarse whisper
came, &#8220;Little torment!&#8221; and I stopped. Again, &#8220;Dear,
little torment!&#8221; and foolishly I looked at him, and for
the last time our struggle was renewed, and now I had
to resist not only his pleading, but that of something
within me that said, &#8220;Think of his little daughter who
cannot tell him good-bye, and kiss him for her sake.&#8221;
Almost I yielded&mdash;and then&mdash;the homesick friend, the
bridge, the knife, and I threw back my head violently
and exclaimed, &#8220;No! No! I can&#8217;t! but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and I
laid my little hand against his lips. He took it gently,
gently, and sighing heavily he kissed it, palm and back,
and every dimple, including the tiny one in my wrist,
and every finger-tip, and then said under his breath,
as it were, &#8220;Good-bye, little maid who knows her own
mind,&#8221; and as the key was turning in the lock after we
had gone from the cell we heard him give a husky
laugh and say, &#8220;She&#8217;s got a will&mdash;it&#8217;s stronger than
mine&mdash;for, mind you, she never kissed me!&#8221;</p>

<p>And that was our last sight of &#8220;the gentleman who
was going to die,&#8221; because that bright day, when Charley
and I were out making the acquaintance of a very
remarkable calf&mdash;remarkable because its forequarters
were mild and gentle, while its hindquarters stung like
an adder&mdash;and we were about to play marketing, and we
both had a desire to purchase the forequarters of the calf,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
and as we never quarreled we drew lots for choice, while
the calf slowly chewed up our market basket&mdash;and at
that very moment, in the city, Goldy-locks&#8217; beloved
&#8220;Mr. No. 3&#8221; was heading a procession to the scaffold
with many a jest about the &#8220;blue funk&#8221; he said the
men were in about him. He remarked their pale faces
and trembling hands, and actually encouraged and
advised them, himself directing the proper placing of the
fatal knot. Then with alert, springy step, bright eye
and cheerful voice he mounted the scaffold, stepped with
quick obedience upon the trap, and was hurled out of
this world into&mdash;what?</p>

<p>White and cold and silent his wife removed her
coffined dead, and when we returned &#8220;the gentleman
who was going to die&#8221; had died. He was gone, and
his cell and corridor knew him no more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Old Myra&#8217;s Waiting</h2>
</div>


<p>Was she mad? I do not know. I only know that
she was old, oh! very old, and had known such sorrows
as break the heart and blast the intellect of many of her
sex. So old, so fragile&mdash;so poor&mdash;with a wit like
polished steel and a tongue like an adder. I was her
one friend in the world and was as helpless as herself.
We each earned our own living&mdash;that was the one
experience we had in common. Save for that, there was
a whole world between us. She stood wavering and
unstrung at one end of life&mdash;I stood quivering and
tense at the other end. She had known it all, all, and
only wished to sleep, to forget&mdash;I knew nothing, and
only longed to learn, to feel, to know.</p>

<p>The first time I saw her she stood on the bank of
the lake, a little, swaying, black-robed figure, facing a
blinding gale. The wild wind tore her pitifully thin
shawl from her shoulders and sent it whirling down
the lonely street. I set my long, young legs in motion
and ran it down, and returning, put it about her sharp,
old shoulders.</p>

<p>She gave me one piercing glance from the blackest
eyes I ever saw. Her dry, pale lips drew back across
her rather long, narrow teeth in a sort of smile, and she
said: &#8220;My dear, you are a wonder; few young people
condescend to run like that, particularly for the old.
I thank you!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>She turned her face again to the lake. Though I
found it hard to keep my position, she somehow managed
to maintain hers, frail as she was. I was puzzled&mdash;why
was she standing there, so thinly clad? I
hesitated a moment, then I said as respectfully as I
could:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame&mdash;could you not go into one of those
houses, or home, perhaps, and let me wait here for
your message or&mdash;or friend, and then come and tell
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her sharp eyes upon my face, and
exclaimed: &#8220;God bless my soul! the girl means a
kindness to me!&#8221; and she laughed a shrill, thin peal
of mocking laughter that made me hot with shame and
anger too, and I turned away with a brief &#8220;I beg
your pardon;&#8221; but she could be quick if she was old,
and her claw-like hand was on my wrist in a moment,
and her sharp voice reached me through the wind: &#8220;I
can&#8217;t, my dear, I can&#8217;t leave now! You see my treasures
are out there, and if they should be given up, I
want to be at hand. Go home! my dear&mdash;go home,
where people are not old and mad, and do not wait for
the sea to give up their dead,&#8221; and turned again to face
the gale, while I flew like the wind from her strange
presence.</p>

<p>Some weeks passed before I saw her again, and then,
as it happened, was able to do her a second small service.
The day was wet and windy, the streets muddy.
I was hurrying down Bank street and was about to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
cross an alley-way, which opens on that street, when I
heard a little cry behind me, and there rolled past my
feet a very neatly done up, small package, with a large
seal on it in red wax. It stopped in the middle of
the alley directly in front of an advancing dray-horse.
I snatched it up and sprang across to the sidewalk,
where I waited for the owner, who came hurrying across
with anxious face and outstretched hands; and behold!
there was my strange, old lady again.</p>

<p>She seized the package, and examining it carefully, she
muttered, more to herself than to me: &#8220;I hope it&#8217;s
safe, a fortune blowing about the muddy streets like
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>My face must have been an expressive one; at all
events she read it like a book, and went on rather sneeringly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not mad; at least, not <i>now</i>! This does
not belong to me; it would not be a fortune if it did;
it&#8217;s lace&mdash;old, rare and very valuable! Had it been
ruined? Oh, it makes me quite faint to think of such
a chance! I am really very grateful to you, my
child!&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke her thanks so gracefully that I felt myself
grow pink with pleasure.</p>

<p>We walked side by side a little way, when she said:
&#8220;My dear, I&#8217;m not a stupid woman, but I can&#8217;t quite
make you out. Your speech and bearing says one
thing, but your being out so much, quite unattended,
says another. Oh! I&#8217;ve seen you many times since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
that day at the lake. Then, your clothes&mdash;they are too
good for poverty; but you wear the same things too
often to have generous and well-to-do parents. No, I
don&#8217;t quite understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were right at the door of the old &#8220;Academy&#8221;
then, and I stopped, saying: &#8220;I go in here; there is a
rehearsal; I am a member of the company.&#8221;</p>

<p>I never saw such fire as could leap into those
fierce, old eyes of hers&mdash;at that moment they fairly
blazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you!&mdash;you with that clean, honest, young
face! For fifty years I&#8217;ve had a curse, hot and burning
in my heart, for theatres and all connected with
them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then angrily shaking her forefinger at me, she
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;You run up your flag, girl!&mdash;your flag of red
and black, of paint and dye!&mdash;that honest craft may
know there&#8217;s a pirate in these waters!&#8221; and, dragging
her veil across her face, she left me standing there,
divided between the desire to laugh and the desire to
cry. A pirate? I was such a harmless, well-meaning,
little pirate that even had I shown the flag, and blackened
my lashes and rouged my cheeks, I doubt if I should
have created a very great panic in the Cleveland shipping&mdash;and
so, at last, the laugh won; and between laughs
I said aloud: &#8220;I am a pirate! I am a pirate!&#8221; And
so a member of the company found me, and paused
and looked me gravely over, and, wagging his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
head desperately, said: &#8220;It seems incredible, such
meanness in one so young, but you will bear in mind
I <i>saw</i> this myself&mdash;a girl of sixteen, who knows a good
story, takes herself out into a cold, damp hall, and tells
this story to herself, and laughs and laughs all to herself,
and then wipes her mouth and goes in seriously
and sadly to join her defrauded brother and sister
artistes. Clara, I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>I had to tell him what I was really laughing at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he said, &#8220;that was old Mrs. Worden.
Do you mean to tell me you don&#8217;t know her? She&#8217;s a
terror, is old Myra! She used to carry this town in
her pocket. She was young then, and rich, and they
do say Myra was a beauty. Hard to believe that, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Her features are really
perfect. Her eyes must have been very fine; her hair
black, and her figure very graceful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he yawned, &#8220;but she has the sharpest
tongue and the longest memory in Cleveland. How
she does lash some of our public men! You know the
rector of Christ Church, the party who abuses theatres
so often? Well, one day there was a race between
the ancient Myra and the long-winded Reverend. She
was overhauling him fast, and he knew it. These doors
stood open&mdash;theatre doors. He was between the devil
and the deep sea, and&mdash;well, quite properly, he chose
the deep sea, and slid in here, and behind that billboard.
Had he only known it, he need not have gone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
behind that board for shelter, for nothing on earth could
induce the ancient dame to enter the door of a theatre;
so he would have been safe had he merely stepped
inside. As soon as she had passed, he tried to slip out
unnoticed, but <i>I</i> was on the spot, I am proud to say,
when I was least wanted, and, lifting my hat, I
informed him that if he wanted seats he would find the
box-office at the head of the stairs. He <i>glared</i> at me,
and then I offered to run up and get him a programme
of the evening&#8217;s performance, but he snorted something
about &#8216;mistaking the entrance,&#8217; and got away. Well,&#8221;
my companion added, with a self-satisfied look, &#8220;if
there is anyone in town who has <i>not</i> heard of that chase
and escape, it&#8217;s not my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;does Mrs. Worden dislike
theatres so greatly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear girl,&#8221; replied my friend Lewis, &#8220;I just love
to instill knowledge into your hungry, young mind, but
fifty cents are always full fifty cents to me, and if I
stand here stuffing you with valuable information, I
shall be late to rehearsal, and fifty cents forfeit will be
torn from my unwilling pocket-book. So <i>en avant</i>,&#8221;
and we both turned our faces stageward.</p>

<p>The next day was very stormy and bitter cold. My
mother insisted upon my wrapping her shawl about me
as an extra protection, but I had not gone more than a
block or two before I was in trouble. The wind tore
at me, the small pins could not stand the strain, they
gave way, open went the shawl. The wind caught it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
and slapped my face with it, and flung it flapping
noisily through the air. I grabbed for it, jumped up
at it, waltzed around and tried to catch it; but truth
to tell that shawl could be found most any place in
the street except on my shoulders. While I was laboring
like a ship in a high sea, I heard some one knocking
on a window-pane, and just as I began thinking I
should have to scud under bare poles for home, the
knocking was repeated so very loudly that I looked up,
and, to my astonishment, there stood Mrs. Worden! I
was amazed, because I had supposed the house to be
unoccupied. The lower part was so, but at the upper
window she was standing and making signs for me to
cross over to her. Still wrestling madly with the
shawl, I plunged over. The old lady opened the front
door, showing an empty and bare hall, and holding
tightly to the door itself, to keep from being blown
backward, she motioned with her head for me to come
in. I obeyed, and stood leaning against the unfriendly-looking
wall, trying to regain my breath. Mrs. Worden
smiled sardonically at me, and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you will get to your precious rehearsal
to-day at that rate of speed. I&#8217;ve been watching you
prancing about with that shawl, and I&#8217;ve brought you
down this.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held out to me a shawl-pin. As I took it, I
found it was yet warm from the hand of its maker
since it was formed of a stout darning needle with a
ball of red sealing wax for a head. She had seen my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
trouble and had hastily made this shawl-pin especially
for me. I was surprised beyond speech for a moment,
and she mistook my silence, for she began to jeer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, use it, use it! If you can keep that shawl
about you it may save you from a sickness. Then you
can hide the pin from the sight of those lords and
ladies at your great, fine theatre. They are so artistic,
I fear its roughness and lack of finish might jar upon
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I shook my head, and, smiling broadly at her, I
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Mrs. Worden, you can never frighten
me again. I know you now, and you are good and kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sort of wonder came upon her: &#8220;Good God!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;You must be madder than I am!&#8221; then she
turned her eyes to the rough, gray lake spreading far
before us, and on her face there grew the look it wore
the first time I saw her. She spoke out quite distinctly,
but apparently not to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if you hear?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wonder?
You used to call me good and kind, aye, and dear, but
that&#8217;s five and forty years ago, a weary time my prettys!
Perhaps the sign is coming soon&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I stood a moment, then I laid my hand gently on
her arm and said: &#8220;See, now, how safe the shawl is;
I thank you very much, and I shall get to the rehearsal
in time, after all.&#8221; She looked a bit bewildered
for a moment, then she asked: &#8220;Shall you be long
to-day?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;I shall be through very
early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then suppose you stop in here a bit and have a
cup of coffee?&#8221;</p>

<p>I accepted the invitation eagerly, and, as I ran down
the steps, she called to me: &#8220;You, girl, who won&#8217;t be
frightened any more, I may be out when you come; see,
here&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find the key, and just go right up
to the front room and wait for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded, and started again, but once more through
the wind came her shrill call: &#8220;You, girl, don&#8217;t you
touch the fire, if you have to wait; mind now, don&#8217;t
touch it; I attend to that myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door slammed shut, and I was slammed down
the windy street, but in considerable comfort, now that
the thick shawl was fastened securely about me. I have
seen&mdash;owned very handsome shawl pins since then&mdash;some
double, with connecting chains of silver or of
gold, and cunningly decorated by the goldsmith&#8217;s skill,
but none ever gave me better service than did that
darning needle with its head of wax, made beautiful
in my eyes by the kindly thought that prompted its
creation. I was really quite excited at the prospect of
seeing her at home. She was an acquired taste. I had
found her bitter at first, but now there was a faint hint
of sweetness rising above the bitterness, and I liked it.
I hurried to keep my appointment, and as I approached
I was struck by the resemblance the house bore to the
woman who lived in it. Both were so old, so gaunt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
so lonely, and, above all, so frail. Surely, I thought,
that trembling, old, frame shell of a house cannot be safe
in any great off-lake gale. And when I first entered it
and mounted its sagging, old stairs I was really frightened
when it jarred at every quick movement and shook
in each blast of wind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Worden was out when I arrived, and so I
entered gladly the front room she had indicated, for,
silly as it sounds, I must admit I am, and always have
been, afraid of an empty house. I went in and closed
the door.</p>

<p>Now, the French say, when colors do not agree &#8216;that
they swear at each other,&#8217; but never, surely, did inanimate
things swell to such a storm of profanity as did
the furnishings of this room. The floor was bare, the
boards were narrow and warped and hungry-looking.
Guiltless of stain or paint, they had been scrubbed to
a creamy whiteness, which somehow gave the whole
floor a peculiarly frigid, unfriendly look. It had a
Pharisaical air, as though it were thanking its maker
&#8220;that it was not as other floors.&#8221; Then, exactly opposite
the door, there hung upon the glaring, whitewashed
wall, in a magnificent frame, a life-sized, full-length
portrait in oil, of a charming girl of about ten years.
The &#8220;swearing&#8221; here was almost audible. The windows,
ill-fitting and rattling in their cases, looked out
directly upon the lake. The bedstead had been a
grand affair in its long-passed day, but now, stripped of
all its luxurious hangings, it stretched its thin, old posts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
up, only to meet the skeleton of its former canopy, while
the silken spread of patch-work, of a brain-destroying
intricacy of pattern, was worn clear through in places,
so that the cotton wadding showed plainly. As I turned
slowly around, I found another great portrait. This
time it was a boy who smiled happily at me from the
canvas; such a handsome, manly little chap, for all his
absurd dress. One only smiled with him, not at him.
I was very much impressed, for I had only been in two
houses where there were family portraits, and I knew
they meant a great expenditure. And then, ignorant
as I was of such matters, I felt sure these portraits
were the work of some great artist, and I was right,
for later on I learned they had been painted by the
most famous artist of his time.</p>

<p>Two small tables, a bureau, a few chairs, all of the
commonest, and a small corner cupboard, completed
the furniture of this odd room. Oh, yes; I must not
omit the screen, then a very unusual object, a tall, narrow,
three-panelled screen, which played an important
part in its owner&#8217;s daily life. And the fire! Thank
Heaven, I thought, for one thing, that did not look
cold. I think there was about one scant quart of fire,
and, as I threw off my shawl, I started to put on some
coal, when suddenly I remembered that injunction,
&#8216;You girl! don&#8217;t touch the fire!&#8217; and I stayed my hand,
but when I looked into the box and saw there just four
pieces of coal, and so suspiciously exact in size one to
the other, and leaning at the end of the box a hammer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
my heart melted with pity; I began to understand.
With a sigh I left the fire, precious but inadequate, and
turned to study the painted pair. The boy, swarthy,
smiling, happy, won your love at once; but the girl&#8217;s
blonde, young arrogance slightly repelled. The portrait,
considered as a picture, was quite lovely. The
dainty figure, in the soft, yellowish-pink gown, stood
out well from the olives and dull greens of the brocaded
curtain behind her. On the table lay her great hat,
while just slipping from her shoulder was the black
velvet pelisse which, by contrast, brought out so beautifully
the milky whiteness of her childish neck. The
features, the lift of the head, the thin, slightly shrewish,
delicate lips were all wonderfully like Mrs. Worden.
But the color scheme was wrong. This handsome, overbearing
child was blonde as she could be, while the boy,
with but one feature of her face, her piercing eyes, was
surely darker than she had ever been. So while I stood
before the girl and thought how clever had been the
artist, who had painted the boy with his hand upon his
dog&#8217;s head&mdash;while in the girl&#8217;s hand he had placed a
broken necklace&mdash;in these bits of detail, I thought he
has given his idea of their character, and just then I
heard Mrs. Worden approaching.</p>

<p>Like many people who live much alone, she had the
habit of talking to herself&mdash;she was talking then. I
heard her say, &#8220;That&#8217;s fifteen years ago, you fool! yes,
all of that. Now, what the devil did I do it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt quite certain she was referring to the invitation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
she had given to me, and I shook with laughter.
When she opened the door, her eyes were snapping
viciously and her brows were brought together in an
inky frown; only her hair was white, her brows were
black as they had ever been, but when she saw me
standing, my hands behind me, evidently studying the
portrait, the frown unknit itself, her eyes softened, and
when I asked: &#8220;Who are they, the handsome girl and
the laughing, little man?&#8221; she answered proudly:
&#8220;They are my treasures, my man-child Philip, and my
Edith, gift-of-God; because of whom I have not cursed
Him long ago and died.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the words, &#8220;my treasures,&#8221; I suddenly recalled
her speech at the lake, and instinctively my eyes turned
towards it. She caught the look, and, going to the
window, she went on: &#8220;My treasures, precious beyond
rubies, they lie out there now; I watch them and wait
for the sign.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, pointing with her long, bony finger, she said:
&#8220;You see that dark line out there on the water; no, no,
the darker, purplish one? That&#8217;s where they lie.
Yes, yes, my prettys, I know, I know! but it&#8217;s weary
waiting, dearies; weary, weary!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice died away so drearily that I felt the tears rising
in my eyes. A movement of mine made her turn to
me. She put her hand up and passed it across her
brow and eyes once or twice, and then, quite naturally,
she went on: &#8220;I was wondering, when I came in, what
I asked you here for.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>I interrupted to say: &#8220;I think it was to give me
pleasure.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t that. I
know now. I thought I&#8217;d like to hear some one talk
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt a bit flattered at that, but she finished with:
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard anyone talk at home since my parrot
died.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down sat my vanity, flat. The old lady had taken
off her bonnet, and, as she motioned me to a chair, she
said, musingly: &#8220;I never can quite remember whether
I learned to swear from the parrot, or the parrot
learned from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She heaved a sigh and proceeded to prepare the tray
for our coffee. As she moved about she continued her
remarks: &#8220;Yes, we did a fairish bit of swearing
between us, Poll and I; her name, by the way, was
not Poll, but Sally, and, of course, I suppose some
one must have taught her to do it, but it was delicious
to hear the &#8216;bloomin&#8217;&#8217; cussing she would give to any
one who called her Sarah. Yes, all things considered,
there was in the past considerable profanity in this
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I, glancing at the splendid frame against the
whitewashed wall, recklessly made answer: &#8220;And it is
not absolutely absent at this moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her bright, old eye glanced from wall to frame, then
back to me, her quick comprehension making my unfinished
thought her finished one in an instant. She
wagged her head and said: &#8220;That&#8217;s not bad, you girl,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
then, with somewhat unnerving loudness, she went on:
&#8220;She&#8217;s young and green, oh! but upon my soul, she&#8217;s
not a fool.&#8221; Then addressing me again: &#8220;So you
know some French sayings, do you? Not many though,
I think; but look, you, young ears are sharp, and you
should have been here before the hangings of my bed
fell to bits. They were of brocatelle and lined with
silk, and they cursed that whitewashed wall so venomously,
had you been here in the bed, you&#8217;d not have
slept one wink, unless your soul&#8217;s already gray instead
of white,&#8221; and she laughed that odd, stinging laughter
that was so like the crackling of thin ice upon a wintry
day.</p>

<p>While she had talked and laughed and nodded, she
had prepared her coffee, and we seated ourselves at
either side of the little table, she taking care to sit facing
the tossing lake.</p>

<p>Oh, that tray! It really seemed as though the
things thereon must come to blows, so fiercely did they
contradict each other. The coffee pot of make and
material precisely like those good &#8220;Bridgets&#8221; purchase
for the use of honest &#8220;Patricks.&#8221; The knives and
forks&mdash;they appeared a bit later&mdash;were of that brand
which always makes you wish that you were dead, they
make of life a thing so hideous. While cheek by jowl
with these rough things stood a few pieces of old porcelain,
deserving, each one of them, a satin-lined box to
rest in. And to keep them in countenance, there were
four spoons of silver, paper-thin, initials and dates quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
worn away, and all a trifle bent and dented in spite of
the owner&#8217;s care of them; while the linen, I could have
cried over that eye-destroying mass of delicate darning.
Truly, there were places in my napkin where the
darning had itself been darned again. But the coffee,
like the fire, which had been increased by the addition
of one small cube of coal, was inadequate in quantity,
but the quality? oh, well, it was perfection, that&#8217;s all;
absolute perfection.</p>

<p>I tasted it and smiled, and sighed. She understood,
and snapped her old eyes at me approvingly, and <i>she</i>
tasted and sighed, and then she slowly said: &#8220;Whenever
I drink good coffee I always rejoice that God
created it. It would have been an infernal shame had
it been invented by some fool man!&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed aloud&mdash;I always did, I&#8217;m sorry to confess&mdash;whenever
she swore, she did it in such an impersonal
way, never, never in anger, never, even when she was
busily engaged in flaying alive some victim of her memory
and her tongue. She generally swore to herself, and
nearly always when in a reflective mood. When I
laughed, she gave me a glance and asked quickly:
&#8220;What is it, eh? Did I swear? Well, don&#8217;t you do
it, that&#8217;s all. But Lord! you won&#8217;t have to live fifteen
or twenty years alone with a &#8216;cussing&#8217; parrot, as I
did. For some time after Sally died I used to say
&#8216;damnation.&#8217; Oh, I don&#8217;t say it now; don&#8217;t open your
eyes any wider, you&#8217;ll meet with an accident. But, you
see, for nearly twenty years that bird told me twice a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
day that her coffee was &#8216;too damnation hot,&#8217; and after
she was gone I had to say it now and then to break the
silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she talked she fidgeted uneasily with her spoon and
cup; at last she broke out with: &#8220;My dear, I asked
you just to have coffee with me, but now&mdash;well, to tell
you the truth&mdash;I am quite faint. I breakfast at half-past
six, that I may have the strong morning light for my
work, and somehow I feel a bit exhausted to-day, and&mdash;and
I&#8217;d like my dinner now, if you can pardon an old
woman&#8217;s offence against all conventionalities, and stay
and dine with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Could I have known, I would have taken the coffee
only and denied my hunger; but I knew nothing, and
cheerfully consented to dine with her. I wondered
where her kitchen was, and, supposing she would be
some time preparing the simplest meal, I looked about
for something to help me pass away the time. There
was no paper, and but one book in the room, a family
bible that might have been bound in a pair of old
boots&mdash;its leather was so browned with age, so worn, so
scruffed it looked. I went over to take it up, when
my hostess, with distinct satisfaction in her voice,
announced, &#8220;Dinner!&#8221; All my life long my generally-absent
appetite has been pursued like an &#8220;<i>ignus
fatuus</i>&#8221; by those near to me, but this time my appetite
met its match; old Myra&#8217;s saw mine and went it about
four better. The knives and forks had now appeared,
simply as a mockery, I believe. Lying on a plate were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
four biscuits, or, as we called them then, crackers. They
belonged to that branch of the cracker family known as
&#8220;soda&#8221;&mdash;soda crackers, and while I looked on in stupid
wonder, she carefully opened a handsomely-cut,
glass box, with a silver lid, which, beyond the shadow of
a doubt, had been her powder-box in days gone by, and
delicately lifted out <i>four little, thin scraps</i> of smoked
beef&mdash;four crackers and those scraps of beef&mdash;no more,
no less&mdash;and we fell to and &#8220;dined&#8221; upon them. But
when I saw her trying not to eat too eagerly, I had a
lump in my throat bigger than our whole dinner. No
wonder her weight was less than a pound for each year
of her weary life. I wished I could gather her up in
my arms and kiss the fierceness out of her eyes and
promise her fire enough for real comfort, and coffee,
and food&mdash;real food&mdash;that would not make the promise
of nourishment to the eye to break it to the stomach.
My thoughts were broken by &#8220;You, girl! is there anything
the matter with your dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing in the world,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;but I was not
very hungry, and, in fact, I do want to get back to my
coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I must say you eat fairer
than ever Sally did, for, I give you my word, for
years on end that parrot cheated me out of at least
half a cracker every day of her life, and yet, my dear,
when she died she was as thin as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I was about leaving her, she said to me:
&#8220;You, girl, I like you! You are queer. You are uneven,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
and you make me guess. You know more and you know
less than most girls of your age, and, thank God, you
don&#8217;t giggle! You may come again.&#8221; She paused and
looked at me with a deprecating expression, and finished
almost meekly: &#8220;That is, if you care to share
your spare time with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I told her, and I told her truly, how glad I should
be to come. How glad I was to live in Lake street too,
and so near to her, and then, rather shyly, I added: &#8220;I
think, if you will let me, I will tell you my name, Mrs.
Worden&#8221;&mdash;and I mentioned it.</p>

<p>She was looking out at the dreary lake again, and,
without withdrawing her eyes, she made answer:
&#8220;H&#8217;m&#8217;m! Clara, eh? Cla&mdash;ra, Claire&mdash;Clarice&mdash;that&#8217;s a
fool name, Clarice? but Clara&mdash;that&#8217;s light, illustrious,
clear, bright! My dear, I&#8217;m glad you are named Clara.
It&#8217;s a good name. I hope it may fit you as well as
mine has fitted me. My French mother meant to call
me Marie, which is, you know, a form of Mary&mdash;&#8216;Star
of the Sea,&#8217; and he who did the sprinkling and the
crossing and the rest was deaf, and he named me Myra&mdash;&#8216;she
who weeps.&#8217; Good God! Good God! Have
I not been well named? &#8216;She who weeps.&#8217; The tears
are all gone from the eyes, now, and they are dry enough,
but hot, my dearies&mdash;so very hot! Internal, cruel
tears that ooze slowly, like drops of thin, old blood,
still fall from my heart, my dearies, while I wait
and wait. Aye, it was before the altar, and with the
sign of the sacred cross, and the touch of the holy-water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
on my brow, that he baptized me &#8216;Myra&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;she
who weeps!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I stole out of the room, where well-bred hunger
showed its teeth so plainly, and softly closed the door,
leaving her in the gathering darkness, a ghost talking
to other ghosts, from whom she was separated by the
thinnest, frailest shell of mortality I ever saw.</p>

<p>And so we went our ways, and did the work that fell
to us. Some nights I pranced cheerily about the stage
in country dances, and made announcements anent that
carriage that always seemed to be waiting for some one
in the old plays, particularly the comedies. &#8220;My Lord,
the carriage waits!&#8221; It is a famous line, a short one,
I know, but powerful enough to produce temporary
paralysis of the limbs and complete dumbness, for the
moment, in strong and lusty youths and maidens.
Well, I was on most friendly terms with that line, and
some nights said nothing more, while on other nights I
went on and played really first-class parts, that being
the manner in which we used to work our way upward
from the very bottom, and felt no shame in it either;
but <i>nous avons chang&eacute;s tout cela</i>.</p>

<p>While I was thus bobbing up and down upon the
restless waters of my profession, my strange &#8220;old lady,&#8221;
who had grown to be my friend, was sitting &#8220;like a gray,
old Fate, toiling, toiling, weaving&#8221; the fairy-like stitches
that made whole again the torn or injured among rare
and precious laces. Her knowledge of them was wonderful,
her love for them almost tender. She would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
shake her head and croon over them, when they were,
in her words, &#8220;badly hurt.&#8221; The day she came nearest
to loving me was the day I said I thought laces were
the poetry of a woman&#8217;s wardrobe. &#8220;Aye, aye,&#8221; she
answered, &#8220;that&#8217;s a good word and well said, girl
Clara. It&#8217;s strange that, without teaching or information,
your keen instinct guides you to the <i>real</i> beauties
of life as surely as the sense of smell guides a young
hound on the trail. There&#8217;s nothing made by the hand
of poverty that is so beautiful as lace; so delicate yet
so strong. Ah! girl Clara, some day, may you see a
bit of Venetian &#8216;point,&#8217; &#8216;round point,&#8217; but if you do,
you&#8217;ll smash a commandment, mark my words!&#8221;</p>

<p>Laces were sent to her from distant cities, and the
package I had caught up from under the horses&#8217; feet
came, as did many others, from the then greatest merchant
of New York. She had received much work from
the South, but the war deprived her of that. So she
went on cutting her expenses down to meet her earnings,
starving quite slowly and making her moan to no
man.</p>

<p>One day I paid a long-promised, much-dreaded visit
to a young friend of mine. We had made our first
appearance in the ballet together, the same night, the
same play, and she was still in the ballet. She was
the young person who gave me the decorated fly-trap
for a Christmas gift. Somehow that remarkable selection
of a gift always seems to have had something to do
with her remaining so many years the chief ornament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
of that ballet. I had gone with her from rehearsal to
her boarding-house. Now, there are boarding-houses
and boarding-houses, but this was just a boarding-house.
The sadly experienced ones will understand exactly
what I mean. The happy, inexperienced ones may just
skip the sentence.</p>

<p>Rehearsal had been long, so we were late for dinner
and we seated ourselves at the long, narrow, untidy,
unfriendly-looking table, with heavy forebodings. Everything
seemed to have been devoured by the boarders
before us, except the pickles. They alone coldly and
sourly faced us. But when the slatternly waitress
came in, I asked myself why, oh, why had I come at
all? A slattern with a cheerful face is hard to bear, but
a slattern who sulks is more than even a boarder should
be asked to endure. I saw my friend, whose name was
Mary, quail as this fell creature looked insolently at
her; but before our doom was sealed the landlady
passed through the room. Now, Mary always said that
had she been alone that incident would have passed
for nothing, and that she would have dined on pickles
and cold water, or not dined at all, but I was there, and
Mrs. Bulkley knew of me, and being stricken for the
moment with madness, saw in me a possible boarder,
therefore she paused and greeted me, and rather
unnecessarily explained that the dinner was all gone, but
added that she reckoned they could scrape something
together for us. And Mary rather ungratefully whispered,
&#8220;she was used to living on scrapings now.&#8221; While<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
we waited, the sulky slattern, regardless of our presence,
proceeded with her duties, snatching everything from
the table, except the shame-faced cover and the pickles.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Bulkley appeared, and our dinner
materialized in the form of liver and bacon and warmed
potatoes, a vulgar dish, but, being freshly cooked, a
welcome one to two tired and hungry girls. Had it
not been for the table-cover we might have been quite
happy, but the sins of the boarders against it had been
many, and as they had not yet been washed away, they
were not pleasant to look upon.</p>

<p>Just as we were being served, Mary remarked that
she had &#8220;seen that awful, old Mrs. Worden giving a
gentleman fits in the street that morning, and that two
other gentlemen were waiting for him, and they had
laughed at him,&#8221; and she ended by asking me &#8220;had I
ever seen her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;I saw her in her room yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Mrs. Bulkley, dropping the spoon
noisily from her hand. &#8220;What&#8217;s that? You saw Mrs.
Worden in her room, her own room where she lives?
Oh, nonsense, you don&#8217;t mean our Mrs. Worden! She
hasn&#8217;t had a soul inside that room since old poll Sal
died.&#8221;</p>

<p>I explained that my Mrs. Worden was &#8220;Myra,&#8221;
owner of Sally, living at number so-and-so Lake street,
mender of laces, etc., and then Mrs. Bulkley dropped
herself, a friendly chair catching her; then she said:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m dummed!&#8221; Then she took off her spectacles
and wiped them on a corner of the table-cover,
which made them worse, as I knew it would, and she
took them off again and wiped them on a grimy handkerchief,
and put them on, and looked hard at me and
said: &#8220;She had you in her room, and you a theatre-girl?
Well, then, she&#8217;s breaking up at last. Well!
Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned her head upon her ugly, old hand, and
I asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know her personally?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know her!&#8221; she snapped out at me. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
she come here every once in a while? and sometimes
she takes tea with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; faintly murmured Mary, &#8220;and when she
comes, a clean cloth goes on the table, and every boarder
in the house who has &#8216;a past,&#8217; keeps in his or her own
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled comprehendingly, while Mrs. Bulkley went
on: &#8220;Do I know her? good Lord! haven&#8217;t I known
her since I was a green girl in my early &#8217;teens?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was startled. Looking at her foxy, false front, her
steel-bowed spectacles, her leathery skin, and the small
framed platter she wore on her chest as a breast-pin,
it was so hard to believe she had ever had any &#8216;&#8217;teens&#8217;
at all!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I know her, as my mother
before me did. She worked for Mrs. Worden for
more than eighteen years, and now she&#8217;s breaking up.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Here, Hannah, make me some tea! You, oh, well, yes&mdash;you
may make enough for us three, and bring it here.
I feel all tuckered out.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the old body did look worried and anxious. I
was surprised, and I was grateful for her interest in
Mrs. Worden, for whom I now had a real affection as
well as a great pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Bulkley!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;don&#8217;t be uneasy; Mrs.
Worden seems quite as well as usual. She works as
hard as ever, too, and she is very kind to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Bulkley, &#8220;that settles it!
Myra Worden kind to anyone in her eighty-third year?
She&#8217;s breaking; she&#8217;ll get the sign she&#8217;s been waiting for
so long pretty soon, I reckon, poor thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>I simply could not help putting the question: &#8220;Do
you know, Mrs. Bulkley, why Mrs. Worden hates
theatres so bitterly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know, my Suz!&mdash;Oh, here&#8217;s the tea, and glad
I am for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tea was good, and I saw by the gratified astonishment
of Mary&#8217;s face that it was a treat. When the
&#8220;Busy B&#8221; (as Mrs. Bulkley was generally called
behind her back) had had her first cup, as a pick-me-up&mdash;a
sort of green-tea cocktail&mdash;she felt better. She
loosened her specs and let them slide well down her
nose, so she could look at me over their tops; she
planted her black alpaca elbow on the dingy table,
and unlimbered, ready for conversation, while, for the
first time in my life, I recognized these signs in a landlady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
without instantly taking flight. &#8220;Why,&#8221; she
began, &#8220;it was like this: Right from the first every one
said she&#8217;d throwed herself away when she took up with
that great, big, pink-and-white chuckle-head, Phil Worden.
But she was just plumb crazy in love with him.
I suppose he must have cared a little for her at first,
but mother always said he just married her out of vanity&mdash;like
gals do sometimes&mdash;she being the biggest catch
in town. Good looks, and money and family the hull
thing! Well, anyway, he was a foolin&#8217; her, or thought
he was, before they was married a year. She knew of
it in no time. Mother thought there&#8217;d be an awful rumpus,
but Mrs. Worden shut herself up all afternoon
alone, and walked and walked, but when supper-time
come she just met him as kind and as sweet! Oh!
Myra used to be sweet enough in them days, and she
just talked and laughed, and he looked like a great
school-boy expecting a good trouncing. Well, that blowed
over, but Myra Worden was always on the watch, I
reckon, after that. Mother used to say he was, somehow,
afraid of her. She loved books&mdash;good Lord! the
books she had; lots of &#8217;em writ in French, too; and
she first off tried to talk of &#8217;em to him, same as to visitors,
and he didn&#8217;t know a thing about &#8217;em. Then she
tried to read them to him, and mother said she
didn&#8217;t know which one she felt the sorriest for, him
or her; him trying to keep awake, or her trying to hide
her disappointment. Well, by-and-by, she gives it all
up, and, if you&#8217;ll believe me, that educated, fine-minded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
woman just took to readin&#8217; out loud to him a nasty,
low-down paper&mdash;I can&#8217;t just call its name now, but all
about cock-fights&mdash;oh, yes! they had dog-fights and cock-fights
in my time, my dear&mdash;and ring fights, and
horse-races, and he&#8217;d just drink it all in, every
word. She was fond of music, and he couldn&#8217;t tell one
tune from another, he said; but that was just an excuse,
because he hated to have to sit and listen to decent
music. Common fiddling suited him well enough. He
was almost stupid in behavior or sulky-like in company&mdash;proper
company; but if, by chance, he was left home
at night and his wife was out, he&#8217;d carry on with the
servants, and sing songs, and play tricks with the cards,
and imitate things&mdash;pigs gruntin&#8217; and corks poppin&#8217;,
and that like, until you&#8217;d laugh to split. In that sort
of way, mother used to say, she thought he felt afraid
of his wife&#8217;s finding out his real disposition, and
she&mdash;why, she just followed him about with
them black eyes of hers, and fair worshipped him.
She was nigh tickled to death when her girl baby
came into the world; yellow-headed like him. She was
only like him in color, however, for of all the domineerin&#8217;
little hectoring brats I ever saw! Well, as I
was saying, Mrs. Worden was the law of this town
then, and it was card parties and coach parties and
sleigh parties and lake moonlight parties, accordin&#8217; to
the time a year, and dinners and suppers and &#8216;routs&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s
what they called &#8217;em then, I remember&mdash;and
people used to come from other places and they&#8217;d stay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
a week at a time, and them weeks was Phil Worden&#8217;s
picnics, his two-forty-on-a-plank days, I tell you.
Now, I never see nobody so dead crazy about theatres
as Miss Worden was. Whenever a company came
here she had the first box, and every night of her life,
unless she gave a &#8216;rout,&#8217; she was in that old theatre.
Yes, I know it, an alley now, and only a few low
variety shows go there, and no women ever enters its
doors, but then it was, my Suz! it just was a fine
theatre. Well, Phil was fond of the show, too, and she
was awful proud of that, and it was &#8216;my Philip is so
fond of the play,&#8217; and &#8216;Mr. Worden will be at the
theatre whether or no&mdash;&#8217; Poor soul! it was so
seldom they liked the same things, but Lord! even
then she was deceivin&#8217; herself. He didn&#8217;t care for no
play; he just went for them dances they used to have
between the acts, and the slack wire performers and
that like; but he knew every man and woman behind
the scenes, and knocked about with them in the
daytime, and I don&#8217;t mean no slurs against you two
girls now, but in them days actors was a rather common
lot. The men nearly all drank too much, and,
what&#8217;s worse, some of the women did, too; and well, one
crowd came here for a long stay, and Phil Worden was
just cock of the walk with them, and before long there
was talk about one special female. She wasn&#8217;t even a
leadin&#8217; actor among &#8217;em, just a brazen hussy who put
paint an inch thick on her cheeks and daubed her mouth
with a dye thing they called &#8216;vinegar rouge,&#8217; because it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
wouldn&#8217;t come off easy, and she was poorer than Job,
and all at once she had beaver bonnets and velvet
pelisses and feathers and long gloves and a muff big
enough for a bass drum. And because the woman was
drunk oftener and oftener, and in her cups was a noisy
and quarrelsome jade who would fight her best friend,
and talked everything right out, all Cleveland began
to wink and nod and say Phil Worden. Well, of course,
Myra must have suspected, but never one cross word
did she give him, nor show him the frown mother said
she had on pretty often them days when he was away.
But, one day, in he comes, near supper-time&mdash;even
Mrs. Worden took her dinner at two o&#8217;clock them
times, and people said it was all airs to have dinner so
sinful late. Well, in he comes, all bunged up, a sight
to see! His eye was all swelled up, and there was blood
smears on his face, and his lip was hurt. Mother happened
to be right there when he came in, and she
looked first thing at Mrs. Worden, and she said her
eyes flashed fire. She stood right in her tracks, looking
in her husband&#8217;s face, and her hands were shut
tight, and at last she said, and her voice cut like a
knife: &#8216;<i>How did you get your hurt, Mr. Worden?</i>&#8217;
and he looked away across the room and mumbled
something about &#8216;sky-larking with a fellow who was
drunk and hit harder than he knew,&#8217; and she, as white
as death and as cold as ice, said: &#8216;You lie, you
coward! You lie! Not even a drunken man fights
with his nails! A woman did that work for you&mdash;&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
and she threw open the door and pointed for him to go,
but in came the two children in their gowns, with the
nurse behind, to tell them both good-night. Her
arm fell like a log, and she made a spring and caught
him by the shoulder and turned him so the young ones
couldn&#8217;t see his face, and pushed him towards her
dressin&#8217;-room and said all in one moment, &#8216;poor daddy!
has got hurted, so mammy must tell you good-night
alone this time,&#8217; and when she kissed them the boy
said, &#8216;Sall &#8217;ou tiss him hurt, mammy?&#8217; and she says:
&#8216;God knows! God knows!&#8217; and mother said she got
away with the dresses she was carryin&#8217; and only knows
that Myra nursed him faithfully till he was able to face
the world again, and for her pay, one week later he left
her, to follow the third-rate actress, who beat him in
her drunken frenzies&mdash;like the dog he was. He left a
letter for her. My mother stood, shaking like a leaf
with fright, but Mrs. Worden stood like a rock and
read it all out loud: &#8216;How he was not her equal, how
she had been too generous and too kind,&#8217; and then
mother said he quite worked up there, and blamed her
hard for not flying out at him when he done wrong.
He said he could have stood it better if she had abused
him, but she held her tongue or only spoke gently to
him, and at the very end that&#8217;s what he said, &#8216;You should
have lashed me, I could have understood that, but your
tongue was not sharp enough,&#8217; and then she stopped, my
mother said, and then she read that line again, &#8216;your
tongue was not sharp enough,&#8217; and then, says she, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
blazing eyes and white lips, &#8216;By God! no other man
shall make that complaint of me! I&#8217;ll sharpen my
tongue like a serpent&#8217;s, and adder&#8217;s poison shall lurk
under my lips!&#8217; and then suddenly she began to laugh
and laughed and laughed, and while we all went a running
for doctors, she laughed her way into the fever that
came nigh to killin&#8217; her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears were on my cheeks, and my tea was stone
cold, when Mrs. Bulkley paused to refill her exhausted
lungs and swallow another bracer. Mary had, meantime,
been steadily eating, grinding with the regularity
of a machine, swallowing with the satisfaction of a
<i>gourmet</i>. She had devoured her own share of the meal
and was now making predatory attacks upon certain
portions belonging by rights to me, and I, believing
that the &#8220;Busy B&#8221; was only getting her second wind
and would start again directly, told her in a whisper to
go ahead and eat it all, an arrangement satisfactory to
us both, since I preferred Mrs. Worden&#8217;s story to eating,
and Mary preferred eating to any story of any
woman alive or dead. Mrs. Bulkley was about to
resume her narrative, when she paused to shout an order
to the cook in the kitchen &#8220;not to use none of that
<i>good</i> butter in no cooking out there,&#8221; and I actually
felt my flesh creep. It was the double shock that told
upon the nerves. There was first that awful attack
upon poor Lindley Murray, pounding him with negatives,
then there were the rending possibilities connected
with the butter that <i>would</i> be used in the cooking out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
there. And I was glad that I was not Mary. Mary,
hearing that order, had simply let her eyebrows
slide up her forehead a bit and then slide down again,
while she went on eating. Mrs. Bulkley suddenly
remarked: &#8220;I see you&#8217;re crying; well, well, I used to
cry about Myra Worden myself, sometimes. But when
you get old your tears come harder, like everything
else, pretty nigh. I don&#8217;t know&#8217;s I exactly sense why
you should cry for her losin&#8217; that great hulk of a
fellow, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;her pride, think of that! To have
been abandoned for some great woman, some rare
beauty, would have been bad enough, but to have been
cast aside for a gross and common thing that cursed
and tore him like a beast, and all in the very face of
the public! How could she bear it all, poor thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mrs. Bulkley, &#8220;she done it somehow.
But I must tell you a queer sort of thing about when
she was sick&mdash;yet it jest shows you what dummed fools
women be. Mrs. Worden had the most amazin&#8217; head
of hair I ever seen in my born days, as black as jet and
hangin&#8217; to a length I darsen&#8217;t name, for fear you&#8217;d
think it lies, and thick! good mercy! Well, she was
in for a long sickness, the doctor said, and no nurse
could do anything with that mop of hern; and so they
ups and cuts it off, and mother cryin&#8217; like a baby when
they done it. But when she found out herself what
they had done to her&mdash;good Lord! she give a screech,
and wrung her hands and sobbed: &#8216;It was the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
thing that Philip ever loved about me. He called it
his great, black mantle, and once he wound it round
and round and round his strong, white throat, and now
<i>it&#8217;s</i> gone; thanks to these meddlin&#8217; fools, who don&#8217;t see
that I can&#8217;t die!&#8217; and she jest cursed every man and
woman in the house, and raved over that hair of hern
every hour when she was out of her head&mdash;when she
was right-minded she never let on she noticed about it.
Well, at last she got well, and straight she put on the
widow&#8217;s weeds that she&#8217;s worn for five and fifty years.
Poor soul! she held her head so high and looked so
hard right into folks&#8217;s eyes, they darsen&#8217;t ask the questions
nor make the remarks they&#8217;d like to. And she
used to spend an awful lot of time and money on the
poor&mdash;and she jest guarded them children as though
they was chuck full of dimonds. But &#8217;twas <i>then</i> she
began to use the sharp edge of her tongue. She didn&#8217;t
talk <i>about</i> folks, she never was one for slander, but the
things she&#8217;d say <i>to</i> &#8217;em was jest awful, and the worst of
it all was, that she always told the truth. If she&#8217;d jest
been abusive and have made up things outen whole
cloth, nobody would &#8217;a cared much; but what was it,
now, that big lawyer said about her once? Let&#8217;s see,
she had been giving him a hidin&#8217; right before folks, and
when she was done, he says, &#8216;The woman who is armed
with sarcasm and truth is a woman whose tongue is
sharp on both edges.&#8217; Yes, them&#8217;s the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;But trouble jest follow&#8217;d right along after, yes, and
pretty close after. &#8216;Mrs. Myra Worden,&#8217; that&#8217;s what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
her cards said <i>then</i>; they used to say Mrs. Philip
Worden&mdash;but when the black went on the &#8216;Philip&#8217;
came off. Mother said that she never heard her speak
that name but jest once, after the time she stood laughin&#8217;
like mad over his last letter. Some one told Mrs.
Worden that some one else had said that &#8216;she had a
tongue like a serpent&#8217;s,&#8217; and mother says her eyes give
a flash and she throw&#8217;d up her head and she said almost
wild-like: &#8216;I swore me an oath and I&#8217;m keepin&#8217; it.
You should have waited; my nails are long now, and
sharp; already I have a serpent&#8217;s tongue. I might yet
learn to cuff, and curse and tear you with the rest!
Ah! you should have waited, Philip!&#8217; My Suz! then
came the trouble. Didn&#8217;t the biggest man, most, we
had in town up and blow out his miserable, dishonest,
old brains, because he had first lost his own money, and
then had thrown away a hull lot of Myra Worden&#8217;s
after it&mdash;expectin&#8217; to get both back, he said. It was
an awful loss. She didn&#8217;t say anythin&#8217;, hardly, but she
shook her head a bit, while she watched the young ones
playing; she only cared for their sakes. Some one said
to her, &#8216;Such a disgrace, I do wonder what his family
will do?&#8217; and she says so quiet-like: &#8216;Get a much
larger monument than is usual, and see that it&#8217;s of
whitest Carrara, I suppose. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s generally
done in such cases.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she give up livin&#8217; in that house, and give up
all the carriages but jest a family affair that the children
could be sent about in, and came down to Lake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
Street. It was a pretty house, but Lord! not like <i>her</i>
a bit. And if you&#8217;ll believe me, that girl, that Edith
of hern, cut up more monkey-shines and was madder
than a hornet about it. Little Phil thought it was fine;
fact was, the little devil was in the lake about half his
time, but nobody liked to tell, and everybody knew the
dog would take care of him anyhow. They got along
all right for a while, she living for the work she could
do for the poor and for the love of them children, and
they for lessons and fun. My Suz! she had &#8217;em so
they could jabber French all the time they was dressin&#8217;
and until lunch, and then at that meal that Dutch
woman she had, great flat-faced, stupid thing, used to
pitch in and make &#8217;em eat that meal in Dutch, or German
she call&#8217;d it&mdash;though I vum! I can&#8217;t see no difference
between the two. And dancin&#8217; lessons! and,
O, Lord! I can&#8217;t remember half they were studyin&#8217; at,
and so their mother let &#8217;em have lots of play too. So one
day, she&#8217;d promised to take &#8217;em to the circus at night,
and they were sure the day would be a year long; and
some one invited &#8217;em to go out on the lake for a sail,
and she ups and says, &#8216;<i>no</i>.&#8217; Well, they was mad; but
she was weather-wiser than any woman I ever see, and
she said to &#8217;em, &#8216;No, my dearies, it&#8217;s fair now, but it&#8217;s
a treacherous fairness. I dare not let you go.&#8217; Well,
after sulkin&#8217; a bit, they asked if they might go and
spend the day at Auntie Anna&#8217;s? She wasn&#8217;t their
true aunt, they jest called her that, and she was nothin&#8217;
but a slave to &#8217;em, and spoiled &#8217;em&mdash;well, don&#8217;t talk!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
&#8216;But,&#8217; said their mother, &#8216;if you go there to take tea,
you will not have time to dress for the circus!&#8217; &#8216;Why,
then, dress us now; we&#8217;ll be careful of our things,
mammy,&#8217; said Edith, &#8216;and then we&#8217;ll come right from
tea, by our ownselves&mdash;oh! please, mammy, yes by our
ownselves, and we&#8217;ll stand on the corner over there and
wave our hands and handkerchers to you for a sign for
you to come to us, and then we&#8217;ll all go on up town
together.&#8217; They were jest sot on that plan. They
felt it would be so big for them to come alone, those
few blocks, and then to stand on the corner and make
signs for her to come to them, and seein&#8217; as she had
already cross&#8217;d them once, she consented, and right
away they were dressed and started off under the
servant&#8217;s care to their auntie&#8217;s house for the rest of the
day. When they had kissed her good-by about a dozen
times&mdash;for the way they loved her jest was a caution now,
I tell you&mdash;little Phil runs back and he up and said,
&#8216;Mammy, I&#8217;ll take care of Edie&mdash;she&#8217;s the biggest, but
I&#8217;m the strongest, and I&#8217;m the nearest to a man, ain&#8217;t I?
So, I&#8217;ll hold her hand all the way when we&#8217;re alone,
mammy, and I won&#8217;t let anybody speak to her, &#8217;till you
come down to us,&#8217; and she kissed him again, and called
him, as she often did, her &#8216;man-child,&#8217; and away he
went after Edie. The next time she saw the poor, little
things, Phil was a keepin&#8217; his word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Worden went on with her doin&#8217;s, whatever
they was, and along couple hours later she sees the sky
darkenin&#8217;. There had been a good many small boats<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
out on the water, and she felt uneasy when she noticed
&#8217;twas getting dark. Everythin&#8217; along the bank was
different then to what it&#8217;s now, you know. Some of
them long slopes was all green and right pretty to sit
out on, and lots of people used to walk there and look
at the lake and do their sparkin&#8217;, and sometimes people
would crowd the bank to watch a wreck and shout and
yell, if anyone was saved. Well, as I was sayin&#8217;, Mrs.
Worden she goes to look out, when a girl comes
screechin&#8217; to her &#8216;that a boat had been capsized, and
the folks that had gone out to save the upset people
were now in danger from the wind that was blowin&#8217;,
and there was crowds out there watchin&#8217; already!&#8217;
Mrs. Worden wraps herself up in a cloak and goes out,
too, to the bank. Lord! Lord! that storm! and the
shortness of it. I had a sailor boardin&#8217; here then&mdash;nasty,
drunken brute he was, too&mdash;he said somethin&#8217;
about their having where he come from what was called
a &#8216;black squall,&#8217; and that that was one. Well, I
don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about black squalls, but I do know,
and you know, and every one else as knows &#8216;Old Erie&#8217;
at all, knows there ain&#8217;t no lake on God&#8217;s earth that&#8217;s
as treacherous or as lightenin&#8217; quick in evil-doing, and
when Mrs. Worden gets out there, the crowd was already
cryin&#8217; out, and wringin&#8217; hands, and runnin&#8217; up and
down. And, sure enough, there right close in was a
bit of a pleasure boat of some sort, and, oh, dear! I
can&#8217;t tell you no rights or wrongs, I was there too, but
when I seen them poor creatures hold out their arms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
towards us standin&#8217; safe on solid ground, I jest sot
right down on the bank, for my legs couldn&#8217;t hold me
up. Then a rumor ran through the crowd that there
was children on the boat, and one great groan went up,
and Mrs. Worden says: &#8216;God pity some poor mother&#8217;s
heart! my own children might have been there, for they
begged to go out to-day, but I forbade it,&#8217; and right
behind her stopped a woman who had come up runnin&#8217;
like mad, and was movin&#8217; her lips and not makin&#8217; a
single sound, and that woman was Aunt Anna. At
that moment a vivid flash of color was seen on the deck,
it was a girl&#8217;s pink dress; next instant the crowd groaned:
&#8216;The children, oh! God! see the children! and they
are holdin&#8217; hands, they look this way!&#8217; A man was
standin&#8217;, holdin&#8217; a pair of glasses to his eyes, and without
a word Mrs. Worden put out her shakin&#8217; hand and
seized them, while the silent woman, with the ashen
grey face, fell down upon her knees and bowed her head
behind her. The instant the glass was at her eyes Mrs.
Worden stopped shakin&#8217;. She stood solid as a rock and
she jest said: &#8216;Oh! Mother of God!&#8217; and there she
stood, and it was only a moment or two after that, oh!
well, there was awful screechin&#8217; from the women and some
groans from the men, and it was all over. I looked
at her. She took the glass from her eyes, and holdin&#8217; it
in her hand a minute, she stood looking down at it,
then she gave a kind of start-like, and she holds it out
to the man, and she said slowly, each word kind of by
itself, &#8216;I thank you, sir, it is a good glass,&#8217; and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
turned and walked a step or two, and then without a
sound, fell all her length, upon the ground. They
carried her to her home, but Aunt Anna was taken to
another house and cared for, and there she told how
she had not been strong enough to refuse them, when
they had entreated, and the people who invited them
were old friends of hers, and would, she knew, be very
careful; but where she took on the worst, was when
she told about how the dog had to be tied, to keep
him from following them. The ladies feared he might
jump into the water and get in the boat again and spoil
their dresses; and he fought like mad to get loose, and
howled and barked his voice clean away. And I
haven&#8217;t no doubt but he&#8217;d a saved one of &#8217;em, for he was
that strong, and a regular water-dog, and he&#8217;d brought
the boy out against his will more than once, when
people had sent him after Phil just for fun. Well,
Aunt Anna was afraid of her life to meet Mrs. Worden,
but she needn&#8217;t have been, for she hardly noticed
her when she did see her. The doctors that come that
time didn&#8217;t like her doin&#8217;s at all. She never cried a
minute. That&#8217;s the truth, and she had seen her own
and only children go to the bottom of the lake hand in
hand. People that went there cried; the help just cried
buckets full, and she looked at &#8217;em, and one day she
said: &#8216;I wonder how they do it? I can&#8217;t!&#8217; and the
doctor, once he got kind of mad-like, and he says:
&#8216;Bend, woman, bend, or you&#8217;re bound to break! Do
you think you have the strength to bear this blow as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
you bore the other one?&#8217; but she only answered
calmly: &#8216;I am what I am! I did not make myself.&#8217;
When he left he felt all upsot and he was cross as a
bear with a sore head, and he said when Aunt Anna
came up to ask about her, &#8216;She will cry, or die, or go
mad; and the last looks the likeliest to me,&#8217; and off
he went. The minister he tried what he could do.
He was a pudgy, kind-hearted man, and he had young
children of his own, and he tried to talk resignation
and that sort of thing, and she jest said to him when
he got good and through, &#8216;Has <i>your</i> house been made
desolate to you in one hour?&#8217; and he jest burst right
out crying, and he says, &#8216;Ah! you poor woman, how
can you bear it?&#8217; and she jumped from her chair and
lifted up her face, and beating on her breast with both
her clinched fists, she almost screamed out: &#8216;Bear it?
Bear it? Why I&mdash;&#8217; she stopped right in a minute and
she sat down and said, &#8216;You will pardon me, won&#8217;t
you? But, see now, you have little ones, yours, your
own blood in their veins, and you can imagine, can&#8217;t
you, the hunger, the agony of hunger I suffer for a
sight of my little ones&#8217; faces? I could wait a thousand
years if only I could see them then, but they&#8217;re out
there!&#8217; waving her hand toward the lake. &#8216;Never,
never, shall I see them again!&#8217; and he, poor, old man,
he jest sobbed and said: &#8216;Never, till the sea gives up
its dead!&#8217; At them words she gave a great cry&mdash;that&#8217;s
the way the minister put it&mdash;she gave a great cry and
she said: &#8216;My God! My God! I had forgotten&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
the sea gives up its dead, and His words stand firmer
than the everlasting hills!&#8217; She threw herself upon her
knees, and holding up her hands she cried out loud,
&#8216;Lord, thou hast sent my soul down into hell, but for
Thy great words, will I praise Thee forever!&#8217; She turned
and kissed the minister&#8217;s hand and blessed him for
reminding her. &#8216;They are truthful children, and have
long memories,&#8217; she said, &#8216;and when the sea gives up
its dead, they will give the promised sign, and I will
join them, and we will all go on together. So I will
watch and wait, just watch and wait for my dear ones&#8217;
sign!&#8217; And that was full fifty years ago, for I was but
eighteen then, and Myra Worden has watched at that
lake&#8217;s side faithful ever since; though from that day
people have called her mad, and I suppose she <i>is</i>, poor
soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed my head upon my hands; dully I heard Mrs.
Bulkley going on about some bank&#8217;s failure, something
about a fire that had followed close upon the failure,
and the word ruin, many times repeated, but my real
attention was fixed upon a picture that rose before me.
I saw, as plainly as I ever saw anything in my life, a
great, level plain, and far away against the angry sunset
sky, a line of low unwooded hills encircled it. It
was unspeakably dreary&mdash;no trees, no water, no rise and
fall, dip or break in the monotonous, dead level of the
ground. Far away to the left, in the growing darkness,
I saw the towers and cupolas of a fair, white city,
and from its distant gates a path was worn across the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
dismal plain&mdash;a path so faint, so narrow, it could only
have been made by one lone traveler&#8217;s feet. At the
very farthest end, and on either side, there were faint
outlines as of fallen bodies, and there were broken urns,
and jars, and some withered garlands; but for all its
greater length, it was narrow, faint and bare. And
while I looked, suddenly, at its opposite end, that nearest
to the hills, there appeared the figure of that traveler
whose weary feet had worn that piteous path.
Behind her, the fair, white city; before her, the bleak
and savage hills. The tall figure, in its sombre garments,
seemed the very spirit of desolation. The face was
turned away from me, but there was that in the figure
which made my heart leap up in quick recognition, and
then, so truly as you live, <i>then</i> I heard a voice, clear
and distinct, but seemingly very, very far away, and it
said: &#8220;I am Myra, &#8216;she who weeps!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave a start so violent that I turned my tea-cup
completely over, and, putting it hastily to rights again,
saw Mrs. Bulkley looking her grimy handkerchief over
carefully to find a promising bit to rub her glasses
with. Her false front was much awry, and her small
eyes were red, and she was finishing, as she had begun,
with the assertion that &#8220;Mrs. Worden was breaking
up, no doubt of that, since she had taken up with a
theatre-girl, of all people on the footstool, well! well!&#8221;</p>

<p>I thanked the &#8220;Busy B&#8221; for her tea and her information,
and I greatly fear I proved an unsatisfactory confidant
for Mary, who dearly loved plenty of &#8220;oh&#8217;s!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
and &#8220;ah&#8217;s!&#8221; and &#8220;did you ever&#8217;s?&#8221; while she poured
forth tales of the numbers of magnificent male creatures
who madly pursued her through life, she always
baffling them, however. By the way, she must have
kept up her habit of baffling the magnificent ones,
because she eventually married a baker with a veritable
low-comedy name, by the side of which &#8220;Bowersocks,&#8221;
would look grave and dignified.</p>

<p>The pain I felt in hearing Mrs. Worden coarsely
and disrespectfully spoken of opened my eyes to the
extent of the veneration and affection I had grown to
feel for her. That creature in whom the world saw
a desolate woman, whose haughty, old head was held
high, and whose piercing, hawk&#8217;s eye spied out its
weakness, but in whom I saw the wearily faithful, old
watcher, by the restless lake, waiting through the long
years, always &#8220;waiting for the sign.&#8221; To me, her sorrows
had made her sacred.</p>

<p>I had never seen any creature who seemed so absolutely
bloodless as did old Mrs. Worden, and no matter
how often I might meet her, the moment my eye took
in the waxen pallor of her face, I experienced an uncanny
feeling of familiarity. I would ask myself, &#8220;Of whom
does she remind me?&#8221; knowing all the time that I had
never seen anyone who resembled her in the slightest
degree.</p>

<p>But one day as she sat, as ever, facing the lake, with
her eyes cast down upon her cup, the cold, dull light
falling upon the clear-cut features of her wax-white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
face, turning it into a veritable mask of death, I looked
steadily at the hollow of her temples&mdash;not the faintest
pulsation there. I gazed steadily at her throat&mdash;not a
pulse-beat could I see, though I knew my own full
throat would throb and swell at times as though it had
an independent existence. As I looked, I thought, if
she should run a needle deep into her finger I believe
nothing would follow its withdrawal, and so, like a
flash, it leaped into my mind who she was like. The
very counterpart of old King Duncan! He of the
mighty tragedy&mdash;the victim of that woman who raved
in her crime-haunted sleep; not of pity at his &#8220;taking
off,&#8221; not of remorse, but only of that stupendous surprise:
&#8220;Who would have thought the old man had so
much blood in him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The good, old man with the wool-white locks, and
the saintly soul housed in the parchment-like body&mdash;yes!
like this he looked. Yet her dagger thrust had
been followed by a rush of royal blood that not only
&#8220;laced&#8221; all his followers and &#8220;pooled&#8221; about his body,
but stained her hand with a stain too deep for an
ocean&#8217;s waves to wash away.</p>

<p>Never since have I read or thought of Duncan without
seeing Mrs. Worden&#8217;s features beneath the golden
round of sovereignty. All the life, the strength, the
spirit she had left, was gathered up into the fire of her
eyes, and when the ashes of her lids covered their glow,
her face was as the face of Duncan, dead. Were Mrs.
Worden living now, she would probably be called a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
&#8220;mind reader.&#8221; Then many people declared her to be
clairvoyant. Be that as it may, she had, beyond doubt,
a wonderful power of reading or guessing other people&#8217;s
thoughts, a power which added greatly to the terror
with which she inspired some of her townsmen whose
thoughts were not always of a quality or nature to
invite close feminine inspection. As for myself, she
had divined my thoughts, time and again, with a calm
exactitude that filled me with awe; and that day, while
I still gazed at her mask-like face, she raised her eyes,
looked steadily into mine a moment, and in an even
voice asked: &#8220;Well? Whom am I like? The Witch of
Endor?&#8221; and, without a moment&#8217;s pause, obediently as
a little child, I made answer: &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am, you are like
King Duncan!&#8221;</p>

<p>A quick frown knit her black brows. Never since
that far-away day of the giving of the shawl-pin, had
she, by word or sign, hinted at her knowledge of my
being an actress, and I saw the allusion to Macbeth
was unwelcome to her. However, she quickly recovered
from her annoyance, and, with her usual aptness,
asked: &#8220;Do you find the likeness purely physical, or
do I, like the old soldier king, &#8216;lag superfluous on the
stage of life&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>To which I gaily and gratefully replied: &#8220;At all
events I shall not, like Mistress Macbeth, try to &#8216;push
you from your stool&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>And her answer, to my annoyance, was: &#8220;How&mdash;how&mdash;is
she going to do it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>She was thinking aloud, but I knew only too well
that her question referred to me; and equally well I
knew that a bad quarter of an hour was directly before
me. Several times the old lady had declared that I was
going to make my mark in the world, but she was
greatly puzzled, very naturally, to know how I was to
do it. She had, therefore, fallen into a way of analyzing
my character, before my very face, with positively
brutal frankness, and, so far, she had always failed to
find out how I was to attain the success she foretold
for me.</p>

<p>Really, it seemed a form of vivisection she subjected
me to, and I squirmed in unpleasant anticipation when
I heard that: &#8220;How&mdash;how is she going to do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had no suggestion to offer, so I drank my coffee
silently. She studied my face a moment, and then she
said: &#8220;Yes&mdash;yes, you will, I tell you! But, <i>how</i>! You
are not aggressive enough to win by <i>force</i>! Oh, you
can fight fast enough, flaring nostrils! but you will
always fight on the defensive. You are clever, but you
are not clever enough! Intellect isn&#8217;t going to win for
you. How <i>are</i> you going to do it? Yet you are to
dominate, to have power. I&#8217;ve seen it in the arch of
your bared foot, in the unbeautiful square of your
shoulders, in the tenacious grasp of your hand. If you
had great beauty now&mdash;there, don&#8217;t redden that way:
never blush above the eyes, it&#8217;s not becoming&mdash;you are
all right; you&#8217;re straight, and fair, and wholesome. You
have enough good looks for men to hang their lies upon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
but you have not a world-conquering beauty. Deuce
take me, girl, if I can make it!&#8221;</p>

<p>While she had been harrying me I had once turned
my head to see why the room had darkened so noticeably,
and saw a heavy fog was creeping in from the
lake, and now that she had come to her &#8220;giving it up&#8221;
place, she turned her eyes slowly toward their usual
resting place, the lake, and a quick change came over
her. She started a little, then her head drooped slowly
until her chin rested on her hand. With unwinking
eyes she stared straight ahead of her, while gradually
the brightness all died out of them, a slightly distressed
raising of her brows threw deep furrows across her
forehead, her nostrils were pinched, her thin lips tight
pressed, while over all her face grew a look only to be
described by one word&mdash;a look of woe!</p>

<p>It wrung my heart! I looked and looked at her&mdash;the
tears rose thick in my eyes, then slowly, slowly I
seemed to understand, to <i>know</i>, what was grieving
her. It was the surrounding fog, silently, steadily,
blotting out everything between heaven and earth!
Even her longing mother&#8217;s eyes could not pierce that
soft density, could not distinguish the purplish, dark
line that, to her belief, marked her darlings&#8217; resting
place out there in the great lake.</p>

<p>I bore it as long as I could, and then I leant across
the tiny table, and, laying my warm hand upon her chill
one, I said: &#8220;Dear Mrs. Worden, do not grieve,
the fog often lifts at sunset. Then, perhaps, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
may see the purple line before the night comes
on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes came slowly back to mine, she smiled gratefully
at me, and then all suddenly the fire flashed into
them again. She rose to her feet, her head held high
in her imperious way, and cried, triumphantly: &#8220;I have
it now, girl! You have given me the clue! You
will succeed by your power of sympathy! You will
not fight the world, you will open your great heart
to its sorrows, and the many-headed public will neither
growl at nor tear you, but will come at your call, your
friend and your defender. When you know you have
succeeded, say once to yourself, &#8216;Old Myra saw, old
Myra told me true.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then with an indescribably tragic gesture she pressed
one hand upon her breast and said: &#8220;She who weeps!&#8221;
while her other hand fell softly upon my head, and she
murmured, &#8220;Clear, Light, Illustrious!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tone thrilled me, there was such sincerity, such
intensity in it. I sat quite silent, but I drew her cold hand
down and pressed my check against it, and that moment
there came a heavy knocking on the lower front door. I
sprang up, saying: &#8220;Let me go, Mrs. Worden, please!&#8221;
and, without awaiting permission, went cautiously down
the sagging stairs and found a man at the door with
the usual sealed package for Mrs. Worden. When the
signing for it was all over, I ran back, calling out joyously,
&#8220;Lace! lace! Mrs. Worden&mdash;more lace! You will
open it before I go, won&#8217;t you, so that I may see it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>Mrs. Worden, meeting my request with, &#8220;You girl!
When are you going to learn not to prance when you
are pleased? Can&#8217;t you keep your joy out of your
legs?&#8221; went, all the same, to the other table for scissors
to cut the cord and seals at once; for she really
enjoyed showing me her precious charges; and I eagerly
watched her every movement. The note enclosed she
laid aside with a scornful, &#8220;Humph! as if I didn&#8217;t
know what to do without their telling me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she unrolled the inner tissue-paper. There
were two pieces of lace within. One delicate, oh! as
cobweb, I thought, as it lay there in its folds. The
other heavier, and a mere scrap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said she, taking it up first, &#8220;why, this must
be, is a bit of old Flanders cut-work, but what a scrap!
Oh, yes! I see now, it belongs to some collector; it is
simply an example of the brave, old work, and I see,
girl Clara, it needs two, yes, three, little brides or
braces&mdash;see where they are broken? I&#8217;ll have a time,
now, to wait for thread to darken to anything like
that tone.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she talked earnestly, almost happily on, about
her little tricks and devices for staining threads, etc.
Then she laid her hands upon the folded lace: &#8220;Ah,
I think you&#8217;re going to have a treat now, this is&mdash;&#8221;
the words died on her lips. From her throat came a
sound, strange, startling, neither sob nor groan, and
yet like unto both! She held a length of lace between
her hands; she swayed slightly back and forth, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
turning my frightened eyes upon her face, I thought:
&#8220;Behold! a miracle!&#8221;</p>

<p>From somewhere, somehow, the weary, old heart had
forced through her shrunken veins one wave of blood
strong enough to mount to her face, where the pained
color slowly grew until it burned into two bright spots
high upon her cheeks. Those two fierce spots, glowing
in the awful pallor of her face, to me were terrible. I
ran to her and, throwing my arm about her, lowered
her light body into the chair close to the table. Her
haughty, old head was bent; one hand still clutched the
lace. I did not know what to do, but it hurt me to
the heart to see her bow her head. Timidly I laid my
hand upon her shoulder. She looked up at me, and
in a husky voice she said, with a glance at the lace: &#8220;I
owned it once, yes, it was mine! I wore it while I was
yet a happy bride!&#8221;</p>

<p>I shivered and turned away, while I mutely prayed
that torturing color might fade from her face before I
looked again. I pressed my forehead to the window,
I could see nothing; no tree, no building loomed darkly
through the fog; I could not even see the pavement
below me. So far as sight went, there were but two
living creatures in the world, and one of <i>them</i> longed
to leave it!</p>

<p>I was so lonely and so sad, I turned back again. She
sat there still, one hand moving back and forth over
the lace. The spots were yet on her cheeks, but they
were not so fiercely bright. I did not know her like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
that. I wish she would accuse me of &#8220;prancing,&#8221; or
tell me I &#8220;sat down too quickly,&#8221; or &#8220;jumped up&#8221; when
I rose. I wished she would snap at me&mdash;that her dear,
old head would lift itself imperiously again. I had not
spoken one word since she told me the lace had been
hers, and so, still silent, I crossed back to her and sat
down at her feet and, hesitatingly, I asked: &#8220;Dear
Mrs. Worden, is the lace much injured?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words acted like magic upon her. In one
moment she had the length of lace passing swiftly
between her inquiring fingers, and an instant later she
gave a cry of anger: &#8220;Oh! shame! just look at this&mdash;the
cruel hurt! and the soil! Why, some vulgar,
new, rich, money-flaunting creature owns this dear lace
now! She is ignorant and coarse! Oh, I know, girl!
Don&#8217;t you see? She has dragged this delicate web
about on the <i>bottom</i> of her gown! Its beauty was lost
in such a position. It was simply done to show the
owner&#8217;s utter indifference to expense. I&#8217;d wager something
that it has been sent, now, by some maid or companion
to be repaired. Ah! I should have recognized it
any way&mdash;but look you, here is the proof that it is mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>She held out to me a fold of the lace, and careful
examination showed where a former tear had been
exquisitely repaired. I nodded my head and she went
on, her eyes fixed upon the old scar: &#8220;As if I could
forget! He did that, my fair-haired giant&mdash;man without
soul&mdash;therefore, husband without honor! But, truly,
he was good to look upon!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>I moved restlessly; she took no notice; evidently I
had ceased to exist for her: &#8220;Fickle, changeable as a
child, unstable as water! But, he loved me for a little
while. He loved me <i>then</i>, the night I wore this lace
to the <i>rout</i>. It was falling full and deep about my
bare shoulders, as they rose from the golden yellow of
my gown that was brocaded with a scarlet flower. I
wore some diamonds and stood with others in my hands,
hesitating, when he came in&mdash;my Philip&mdash;and looked
at me reflected in the glass, and, standing behind me, he
said, in the great voice I loved: &#8216;Burn my body, but
you are a handsome woman, Myra!&#8217; and he kissed me
on the shoulder. &#8217;Twas like wine taken on a cold day;
I felt it mounting to my brain! We were at Christmas-tide,
and a bough of holly was hanging above the dressing
table. He broke a bunch of its scarlet berries and
dark, bright leaves, and, with a great jewel, fastened it
here, in the lace at my bosom. His fingers were clumsy
and the leaves were sharp as needles, and so my lace
was torn&mdash;but what cared I? The sharp leaf-points
wounded my neck, too, and drew more than one drop of
blood, but had they come straight from the heart, I
would still have worn the ornament his hand had
placed. My Philip! so much I loved him&mdash;loved him!
Bibber of wine and companion of harlots; fair, like a
God, yet without soul; so, being soulless, why should he
be cursed for riotously living in the sunlight, and for
following in the train of the scarlet woman&mdash;with the
laughter of fools ringing in his ears! The lace is here,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
the smooth, white shoulders are shrivelled and bent,
the black crown of hair he loved is gone, he is gone,
only the lace and my memory are left!&#8221;</p>

<p>I drew softly away from her. I felt as guilty in
listening to her self-communing as I could have felt
had I opened and read one of her letters. I took my
cloak, and as I drew it on, I heard her low voice saying:
&#8220;You said my tongue was not sharp enough,
Philip; that was because I loved you! <i>Her</i> tongue
was sharp, she cursed and flouted you, and stung and
maddened, and tossed you a favor as a bone is tossed
to a dog! She was not even beautiful, your frail one,
but she knew well the ways that lead down to darkness
and to death! She led, steeped in vice and reeling
with wine, and you followed because you were without
soul, my Philip!&#8221;</p>

<p>I crept out of the door and left the bowed, weary,
old woman patiently examining the torn meshes of two
webs. One her web of lace, the other her web of
life. And as I stole through the chilly, gaunt, old
house not one of its faint voices&mdash;and it had many&mdash;whispered
to me: &#8220;It is nearly over&mdash;a little while and
you will come no more! A little while and she will have
gone, and there will be no one, and nothing here only
the old, old house, and we, its voices!&#8221;</p>

<p>Some very busy days followed&mdash;long rehearsals every
morning, and a new part, of greater or lesser length,
every night; and it must have been a fortnight later
when, being out of the bill, I put a bit of work in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
pocket, took a book in my hand, and thus prepared for
finding my old friend either in or out, started to make
her a visit.</p>

<p>As I approached her door, I heard her talking, and
said to myself, she must be over by the fire-place, her
voice is so indistinct.</p>

<p>I tapped, but received no answer. Just then there
came a pause in the talk within, and I tapped again;
this time more loudly, but, to my surprise, I received
no invitation to enter, though the talking was resumed
in another moment.</p>

<p>I felt somewhat hurt, and turned to go away, but
something restrained me, and I thought I would first
make <i>quite sure</i> that she knew of my presence, I would
knock loudly. As I raised my hand to do so, I heard
a groan. That was enough for me; I waited no longer
for permission, but opened the door and stepped in,
and there amazement held me motionless; I no not
know how long, for this room, whose orderliness had
always been of that precise and rigid kind suggesting
daily measurements with a foot-rule, was now in complete
confusion. Chairs out of place, garments here
and there, and the usually spotless hearth a mass of
gray ashes and fallen black cinders.</p>

<p>And that small, rumpled heap of clothing at the foot
of the bed, with white hair tossed and tangled&mdash;was
that&mdash;could that be my Mrs. Worden?&mdash;she whose
habits of neatness and purity were carried to the
extremities; she who on a bitter winter morning, as on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
every other morning, sought such cramped privacy as
her gaunt, old screen could secure for her, in the farthest,
bleakest corner of her room, and there, with
unskimped thoroughness, went through with the same
process of grooming she had indulged in sixty years
before, when she had had her maids to help her, after
which she put herself into a sort of bolster case, with a
hole in the far end for the passage of her head&mdash;and
in this blue linen bag she became her own housemaid,
and when the toilet of the room was finished to the
points of its very fingers she again retired to the privacy
of her screen and finally emerged &#8220;clothed and
in her right mind,&#8221; as she used to say, when she
appeared in her worn, old black gown, her black silk
apron, her snow-white collar and small cuffs, and her
bit of white tulle, by way of cap, upon her satin-smooth
hair&mdash;and was this she, was this her room?</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Worden drew down the arm which
had been resting across her face, and, looking at me,
exclaimed: &#8220;Oh, Betty, you are so late! Is breakfast
ready now? My head aches, Betty; you never
kept me waiting so long before!&#8221;</p>

<p>She rolled her head from side to side, and moaned a
little, and while I threw off my wraps I recalled, with
a heavy heart, the words of Mrs. Bulkley: &#8220;She&#8217;s
breakin&#8217; up; old Myra Worden is breakin&#8217; fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hastened to reduce the room to something like order,
to mend the fire and prepare some tea and rather doubtful
toast, and when I had placed her in her chair and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
her eyes took in the familiar picture of the lake,
they cleared perceptibly. She nodded her head and
murmured: &#8220;Yes, my dearies, yes! I&#8217;m waiting
for the sign, you won&#8217;t be long now! no, not long,
not long!&#8221;</p>

<p>I came to her, then, with the tea and the toast, and
was delighted when she called me &#8220;you girl&#8221; again,
and hoped she would scold me about the fire I had
made, but she scolded me no more forever.</p>

<p>She had asked so many times for breakfast, yet now
she could not eat one morsel, but she drank her tea
like one famishing. While I arranged her bed, she
babbled on, and most of the time she talked to her
children. Once, however, she declared that if Sally
stole another cracker she would throw her from the
window, and vowed no one in town would be fool enough
to pick her and her vocabulary up.</p>

<p>When I was smoothing her white hair into something
like its usual order, one lock escaped my fingers
and fell forward on her chest. She saw it and cried
out: &#8220;They have cut it off, oh, curse them! curse them!
Betty, do you see? It&#8217;s gone, and&mdash;&#8221; she paused, looking
curiously at the thin, glittering strand of hair&mdash;&#8220;and,
Betty, either I&#8217;ve gone mad or it&#8217;s quite white!
Oh, Betty, I <i>can&#8217;t</i> understand!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, as Betty&mdash;some long-dead Betty from her
past&mdash;I put the suffering woman back into her great
skeleton of a bed, and smoothed her brow and wet her
lips times uncountable, wondering at the heat in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
dry, parchment-like skin, while I tried to decide what
ought to be done in this emergency.</p>

<p>I felt that a doctor should be summoned, but I stood
in absolute awe of her will, her commands, and I knew
her fixed determination never to have a physician&#8217;s
care. She held &#8220;she <i>could</i> not die, no matter what
her ailments, until she had &#8216;the sign,&#8217; and that when
&#8216;the sign&#8217; had once been given no power on earth
could keep her here.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I dared not summon proper help; my next thought
had been, naturally enough, of Mrs. Bulkley, the only
friend of the old days left to her, but as fate would
have it, Mrs. Bulkley was absent from the city on business
that would detain her two or three days. Had I
not heard my friend Mary rejoicing the night before
over the very &#8220;high Jinks&#8221; the boarders were hoping
to enjoy during that absence?</p>

<p>Then indeed my spirits sank, and I could only sit
there and watch over her until she became calmer, and
then I thought I would slip out and tell my landlady
and get her to advise me what to do. And so the hours
passed slowly by, and I looked them in the face with
young, impatient eyes, and never noted their dread
solemnity. For all my anxiety for the woman who was
&#8220;breakin&#8217; fast,&#8221; I had no faintest suspicion that she
was <i>already broken</i>&mdash;that each time the clock struck off
the afternoon hours&mdash;the four, or five, or six&mdash;it was, for
the ancient woman in her gaunt, old bed, the <i>last time</i>.</p>

<p>To know that we are doing a thing for the <i>last</i> time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
lends a touching grace to even the commonest act; but
I was blind with that black density of blindness that
can come only upon the very young, and therefore the
very ignorant, and I only waited for the chance to slip
away and ask for help for her.</p>

<p>She had been quiet for some time, and I softly rose
and tried to leave the room, but she stopped me. &#8220;Do
not go, girl Clara,&#8221; she calmly said, and I, rejoiced,
went back to her. She was quite reasonable again,
expressed a small want or two, wished to be lifted
higher that she might see the lake better; and when all
had been accomplished, she asked me if I would stay
the night with her. Then, with great diffidence, I told
her I thought she should have a doctor first; she raised
her hand and looked at me with such imperious fire
in her black, old eyes that I silenced myself and stood
quite meekly before her, while in a few sharp words
she disposed of the &#8220;doctor&#8221; question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, what was wrong any way? She supposed
she had wandered a little in her speech. Well, what
of it? All Cleveland called her mad. I must have
heard that often enough? Why, then, a doctor to-day
in special? As for Mrs. Bulkley, if she or anyone
else entered this room, she would find strength to put
her on the proper side of the door. Ah! she would,
she was not so helpless, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>In terror, lest she should again bring on her fever,
I yielded to every demand, and so peace came again.</p>

<p>In the long silence that followed, I noticed that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
wind was rising fast, that each blast was stronger and
longer than the one preceding it, and that the old house
trembled ominously under each fierce gust. The shadows,
that earlier in the day had been content to linger
in the corners, had with stealthy boldness advanced till
they had filled the room with darkness, through which
I heard the faint, fluttering breathing of the sick woman
in her great bed, and the shrill scream of the wind as
it swept across the lake to hurl itself upon the challenging
city.</p>

<p>I rose at last to light the lamp, and lifting it, was
about to place it back of the tall head-board of the bed,
that its direct rays might not disturb the possible
sleeper, when by chance the light fell full upon the
painted face of the laughing, little Phil. The effect
was wonderful; it seemed a face alive. The roguish
eyes, the merry smile betraying the whitely even teeth,
the little brown hand holding back the panting dog.
He was joyous life personified, and I stood there wondering
where the laughing child had found the courage
to meet death so bravely; and, as if in answer to my
thought, the faint voice of his mother came from the
old bed, saying: &#8220;Yes, he was very brave, my man-child
Philip, brave, brave! You know I saw it all.
Aye, it was a good glass, a strong glass, and I saw.
She was afraid, though she was the older, and her poor,
blue eyes were strained and wild, and her quivering
lips were white like her cheeks. But my Philip held
her hand and stood still, while many raced madly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
and fro. At one great, approaching wave I saw his lips
move and I felt he cried, &#8216;Mammy!&#8217; I, too, thought it
was the end, but as it broke and surged away they were
still standing hand in hand, and I knew Eternity in the
moment I stood waiting there, waiting for that which
came! There were cries and groans about me. The
mighty wave seemed for one second to stand quite still,
then with blinding, crushing force it struck its awful
blow! It was enough; the solid deck sank swiftly from
beneath their feet, the water rushed between their
frightened, little lips into their laboring lungs, and it
was over! With uplifted faces, and hands tight-clasped
together, they went down before my tortured eyes! Ah,
God! &#8217;twas hard; in one hour my life made desolate!
Yet will I worship Thee, forever! Hast Thou not said,
&#8216;the sea shall give up its dead&#8217;? Aye, and for that great
promise I worship and bow down! By the word of the
Lord were the heavens made. The word of the Lord
is true!&#8221;</p>

<p>The thin, curiously faint voice sank into silence for a
few moments. I placed the lamp as I had intended,
and seated myself by her bedside again. She faced the
lake&mdash;the curtains drawn entirely away from the window.
I faced her, leaning slightly against the bed.
Her eyes were nearly closed, but her lips were moving,
and presently she said, as if continuing a conversation:
&#8220;No, you do not care for her. No! because her golden
head is high, and she holds the broken necklace in her
hand. Why broken? Did he have second sight, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
artist? Did he know, and was the broken necklace in
her hand meant as a warning to me? You care for my
man-child, because he laughs. You do not care for my
&#8216;gift-of-God,&#8217; because of an air, a manner; you are
wrong. &#8217;Tis but a way, a trick of movement. On my
breast, with love-tightened, little arms about my neck,
she was as sweetly lovable as the meekest little maiden
in the land. And when they knelt in prayer, with
folded hands, her head was bowed as humbly! Oh!&#8221;
she suddenly cried, &#8220;Oh! not to have their sweet bodies
to love and caress and care for, not to have their eager
minds to guard, to direct, to develop!&#8221;</p>

<p>She moaned piteously, and then, giving a great sigh,
she added: &#8220;But His word is true, and there is the sign
to wait for&#8221;&mdash;and so sank into a long silence.</p>

<p>I was watching her closely, and suddenly she seemed
to cease to breathe. I rubbed her hands; I called her
loudly. She feebly opened her eyes and turned them
toward the cupboard in the corner. I flew to it, and
searching eagerly, I found two or three bottles there, one
marked cordial. I administered some as quickly as I
could, and saw her revive, but from that moment I was
frightened, and I noted every word she spoke and every
movement that she made. Her first words made me
shiver. She said: &#8220;I am not afraid, girl Clara, but I
must have the sign. I cannot go without it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a pause, while I resumed my seat facing her,
she said: &#8220;It&#8217;s very good of you to stay with me.
Strange, after so many years alone, to have companionship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
at the last. Old Myra Worden watched over by
an actress! Verily, the world does move!&#8221; A pause,
and then she babbled on: &#8220;Ever since the night you
came to me out of the storm and tried to be kind to me,
I have known you were some way connected with the
sign. You admired my treasures there, you loved my
old laces, and sometimes I thought&mdash;I almost thought
that you liked me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Mrs. Worden,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;I love you very
much!&#8221; and I lifted the hand I was holding to my lips
and kissed it. I felt her start, her black, old eyes
flashed wide open, she gave me a piercing glance and
exclaimed: &#8220;What?&mdash;what&#8217;s that you say&mdash;you say&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>I repeated with tears in my eyes: &#8220;I say, I love you
very much,&#8221; and again I pressed my lips upon her cold
and trembling hand. She closed her eyes; she pressed her
thin lips close, but could not hide their quivering, and
presently, in almost a whisper, she murmured: &#8220;Fifty
and odd years since those words were used to me. &#8217;Tis
almost like a foreign tongue. But, oh, my girl, my
girl! it&#8217;s mighty pleasant hearing. You&mdash;You&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you&mdash;I love you very much,&#8221; I slowly and
lowly repeated, and she nodded her head at each word,
and, smiling faintly, sank into quietude. The time was
long, the clock struck more than once, and she had not
moved. My hand was holding hers. I feared to
release it lest I might disturb her. The fire was long
out, and I was cold. I wondered if she was asleep. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
had twice been deceived on that subject, and dare not
venture an opinion. I longed for dawn. Leaning on
the bed, holding her hand closely in mine, I raised my
tired eyes and began dully following the involved
design carved upon the high head-board. I do not
know just when I lost the design, but I felt no shock
when I realized that I was looking at the lake, though
I had not turned round. I wondered faintly how it
could be, but I went on gazing quietly across
the heaving, tossing, gray, repellant waste, and in the
changes that followed I heard certain words, but
whether those words were spoken by myself or fell from
the lips of the ancient woman at my side, I shall never
know. I only know I heard&mdash;I saw.</p>

<p>At first the sky was dull and gray and heavy, like
the lake; but as I looked far, far off, where the sky and
water met, there came a whiteness of the purity of snow,
and it grew and spread and filled up all the sky so far
as eye could reach, and then I heard a voice say, faint
and low: &#8220;Can it be mist?&#8221;</p>

<p>And at the words the whiteness became lambent with
living fire. As sheet-lightning plays across the summer
sky, so this soft fire flashed on, in, through, up, down
and across the milky wonder, while the lake&mdash;oh, marvelous!
The heavy gray was gone, the water clear, pure,
brilliant, vast&mdash;lay like a mighty crystal, and the voice
murmured: &#8220;As a sea of glass!&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently this lambent whiteness began to throb and
thrill with color; streams of pink and rose, of amber, blue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
or violet, played up and down the sky&mdash;a green so vivid,
so acutely pure, that the voice, speaking from the great
book, said: &#8220;A rainbow like unto an emerald.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between me and that great background of living,
opulent color I dimly saw a movement in the air, and
then it thickened with crowding, opaque, white shapes,
even as one has seen the air thicken with the white
movement of the snow-flakes&mdash;so now, from horizon to
zenith and to horizon again, all the air was filled with
the swift-moving, never-resting, great, white-winged host,
and ere the cry in my throat could escape my lips, these
unnumbered ones fell apart into two vast bodies, while
between them there lay straight across the bosom of the
crystal waters a broad path of glittering light.</p>

<p>My heart was plunging wildly against my ribs when
I heard the voice, so low, saying: &#8220;The sea knew
Him&mdash;knew His voice&mdash;His touch! How the waves
must have rushed upon the sand to kiss the precious
foot-prints His sacred feet had made!&#8221; And while these
words were uttered, out, far out, upon the glittering
path arose a radiance, even then intense, almost beyond
the power of mortal eye to bear; my swift lids fell to
shield my dazzled sight. Yet one moment more I
gazed and saw&mdash;I say I <i>saw</i> that supernatural radiance
taking form and substance and assuming the attitude of
most majestic humanity.</p>

<p>I could bear no more; I threw the sick woman&#8217;s hand
from me to clutch at my own strangling throat, and all
was gone! I saw the carved head-board&mdash;nothing more!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>Shaking like a leaf, I turned my head toward Mrs.
Worden&#8217;s face, and dimly I understood that, by some
route of nerves, <i>her</i> vision had been conveyed to
my brain. She sat there against her pillows gasping,
her nostrils quivering, her black eyes fairly blazing.
She passed her tongue across her parched lips, and I
heard the low voice say: &#8220;It cannot be&mdash;no, it cannot!
for He has said no man shall look upon His face! But
it might be, perhaps, that! Oh! I can raise my eyes
no higher&mdash;the light is blinding&mdash;and yet, and yet&mdash;oh!
&#8217;tis He! It is the Master!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her hands were clasped upon her breast, her body
shaken by her laboring heart&mdash;while in terror of that
recognition&mdash;her soft, white hair crisped itself, and
moved upon her brow and hollow temples, while in a
husky whisper she repeated: &#8220;&#8217;Tis <i>He</i>!&mdash;the All-Beautiful!
Do I not see His sacred feet, beneath the falling
robe press the gently yielding, watery path? Can He
have come in fulfillment of the great promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, with a piercing cry, she stretched out her arms
pleadingly, saying: &#8220;Master! Master! I may not look
upon the glory of Thy face, but Thou wilt hear me!
Oh! Thou lover of little children&mdash;pause&mdash;pause!
They lie so near Thee, but one step away! Thou wilt
not pass them by! Summon them, Son of Mary! always
pitiful to mothers, pity me! and summon them! Ah!
the Hand is raised&mdash;the Blessed Hand, irradiating
Light&mdash;is raised, and there&mdash;there&mdash;Oh King of Kings!&mdash;they
are there! Hand clasped in hand&mdash;at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
Beloved Master&#8217;s knee&mdash;they smile at me! they raise
their little hands, and, Power Supreme! <i>they make the
sign!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The room rang with her wild, triumphant cry of joy!
She flung her frail arms wide, and repeated: &#8220;The
sign! The sign!&#8221; then, &#8220;Yes, my dearies, mother&#8217;s
coming! We will fall down and worship, and then we
will all go on together!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her arms dropped suddenly&mdash;her black eyes closed&mdash;and
she fell sidewise into my arms; and even in the
very moment of placing her upon her pillow I cast one
glance through the uncovered window and saw but the
sullen sky bending low over the still more sullen lake.</p>

<p>She never opened her eyes again, and as she lay there
so still, so white, I could not but notice how gentle her
face had grown, and bending down for the first and
last time, I kissed her tenderly. A slow smile came
about her lips, and she spoke for the last time, when
she said softly, happily: &#8220;The sign! <i>It is</i> the sign!&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later there was a long sigh, broken by a
shiver, and then stillness, perfect stillness, and I whispered:
&#8220;They have all gone on together!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="In_Paris_Suddenly_mdash">&#8220;In Paris Suddenly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</h2>
</div>


<p>I saw it in the <i>Herald</i> this morning: &#8220;In Paris
suddenly, Madame de B&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221; Nothing remarkable
about that announcement. Nothing to affect the
general reader, but to me the letters were luminous.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Paris suddenly, Madame Miriam de B&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;
The creep is in my blood yet, for you see, I met Madame
Miriam de B&mdash;&mdash; once, and if I were to live in this
world even unto a hundred years, I should not forget
that brief meeting.</p>

<p>The house was crowded; we were yet in the first act
of the running play, one night, when a companion, a
young society woman (who was trying to unlearn in a
theatre all she had been taught as an amateur) edged
close to me and whispered: &#8220;Look at the woman in the
box; is she not beautiful?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked and answered quickly: &#8220;She is handsome,
not beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see any difference between the meaning of
the words,&#8221; she pouted, &#8220;but look well at her, I have
something to tell you when&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the action of the play parted us, but brought
me close to the box. I had needed no urging to look
well at its occupant. I could scarcely take my eyes
from her, there was something so strange, so odd about
her. She was not young. She was most stately in air
and figure. Her head was most beautifully shaped,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
her features regular, her chin firm and deeply cleft,
and her eyes&mdash;not black, not brown&mdash;yet dark,
radiantly dark. Their soft shining seeming to contradict
the cold strength of her face. Her brows&mdash;ah, at
last, here was the bizarre touch! Her eyebrows
formed one straight line. I don&#8217;t mean that they nearly
met or were thinly joined; they were thickly and darkly
united, in one threatening sweep, above her glowing
eyes, giving that hint of tragedy to her face that so surely
accompanies united brows on either man or woman.</p>

<p>Once her eyes caught mine and calmly held them
fast, and in that moment, as a child may flash a blinding
ray of sunlight from a mirror into your face, there
flashed into my mind these words: &#8220;Only a qualified
admiration, eh? And you feel something, eh? You
don&#8217;t know what? No! and you won&#8217;t know either,
my dear!&#8221; and I ended the act with cheeks as hot
from wounded feeling as though the words had actually
been spoken to me.</p>

<p>I was not in the second act, neither was the &#8220;young
society woman,&#8221; or at least she was on the stage for
about three minutes, after which she came, swelling
visibly with importance, for in very truth she had
something to reveal, and first exacting, on word of
honor, promise not to tell (I only do it now, when:
&#8220;In Paris suddenly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;). She quickly began:
&#8220;You can see she is a lady, can&#8217;t you? Born in Boston&mdash;perfectly
lovely family&mdash;old&mdash;very old, you
know! Was splendidly educated, and the very day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
of her <i>d&eacute;but</i> in society&mdash;I don&#8217;t know who brought
her out, her mother was dead, you know&mdash;that very
day her father killed himself! Ruined&mdash;no courage
and all that&mdash;she had no near relatives! Went off
alone&mdash;went abroad&mdash;worked at teaching or companioning
or something! Things then went wrong&mdash;troubles
came, awful troubles! Oh&mdash;oh!&#8221; The speaker&#8217;s
eyes looked fairly scared, her hands trembled, she
drew close to me, and holding fast a fold of my dress,
she with desperate haste flung out these words: &#8220;She&mdash;that
American woman&mdash;that lady sitting there&mdash;she
has been accused of murder! Why, she has stood
trial for her life!&#8221;</p>

<p>I could only gaze at her in stupid silence, and after
a moment she rambled on about her uncle being
Madame de B&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s lawyer, and his having charge of
her affairs over here, as she would not live here&mdash;would
not settle anywhere in fact&mdash;just wandered from place
to place, etc.</p>

<p>As last I broke in, with a gasp: &#8220;Murderess! She
a murderess? But why&mdash;how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried my informant: &#8220;She was innocent,
of course, or I should not know her (I had not thought
of that). But she had a narrow escape, and owed it to
a man she had always hated; to the dead man&#8217;s valet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, and more impatiently, I broke in: &#8220;But
why&mdash;how&mdash;who?&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught the last word, &#8220;who,&#8221; and went on:
&#8220;Who was killed? Why, Count de Varney! He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
was a wicked, old wretch! Had a palsied arm, and
was broken in health when Miriam first met him!
Well, for years she bore his name, and she was the
active mistress of his great, lonely home, and a most
devoted nurse to him, but she was terribly alone! The
servants, who disliked her because she was a foreigner,
she ignored all save one, the Count&#8217;s valet&mdash;him she
loathed! She tried to have him sent away and failed,
and he knew she had failed. Not a pleasant situation,
was it? I must tell you, that in the left wing of the great
building there was a room whose windows chanced to
overlook those of the private apartments of the Count
and Countess, in the main building. This peculiarity
was well known, too, and highly valued by the spying
servants, and from that room came the evidence that
so nearly ruined their hated mistress. The Count had
been improving, but as his strength increased his temper
roughened, and one day, through one of his bursts
of rage, she learned that she had been cruelly, deliberately
betrayed&mdash;tricked!&mdash;by the merest mockery of a
marriage; one that, in France at least, was utterly
worthless! Surprise&mdash;anguish&mdash;shame&mdash;all at last
were lost in fury! A fury so wild&mdash;so filled with
threats&mdash;that the Count fairly quailed before it&mdash;begged
to be spared a scandal&mdash;swore he would yet
marry her&mdash;nay, he would now, this moment, draw up
his will and make her his heiress! Give all to her in
her maiden name&mdash;so that she should be protected,
should aught happen to him before he could marry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
her! This will he proceeded to have drawn up at once,
for you see, during those past years, Miriam had
learned much of his outrageous past&mdash;knew more of his
secret ill-doings than he quite realized&mdash;knew, indeed,
that he had placed himself within the reach of law!
And now, in her otherwise helpless anger, she determined
to at least punish him with a great fright. So
she secretly prepared and sent an unsigned letter, of
seeming friendly warning, to the Count, telling him of
the very worst of his past acts. That he had been
discovered at last, and that by the evening of that day
the officers would arrive at the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> to arrest him!
The letter came&mdash;Count de Varney read it! Miriam
had thought to frighten him, and she succeeded so perfectly
that the old man&mdash;white-lipped&mdash;rose from the
table, and took his trembling way to his own room,
where he hurriedly and clumsily hung himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;I thought you said he had been
murdered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she said impatiently&mdash;&#8220;Wait! Over in
the wing-room there was a woman, not spying on the
movements of her master or mistress&mdash;she afterwards
swore&mdash;but being in love with the valet, she was watching
for him, and so happened to be a witness to the
hanging of the old Count. No sooner&mdash;swore this
woman&mdash;had her master kicked away the chair on
which he had been standing, than a door opened and
Madame de Varney entered. For one instant she
stood apparently stunned by the sight before her&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
then she laughed! She made no movement to call for
help&mdash;she offered no help herself, but came closer to
the writhing, horribly-struggling, hanging figure! The
woman swore that once her master threw out his hand
imploringly&mdash;that she thought he touched her mistress,
she was so close to him&mdash;but she, the witness, turned
faint just then at the awful drawing up of the hanging
man&#8217;s limbs and did not see quite clearly&mdash;but another
servant joined just then, and both watched&mdash;and swore
that only when the master was quite still did the mistress
move, and then she went first to a desk and looked
at some papers, and then rushed to the door, throwing it
open and calling for help! She rang the bell violently,
and the valet rushed in at her call, as if he had been
standing at the very door&mdash;but before he made a movement
to cut down the body, he spoke fiercely and rapidly
to the Countess, and turned to the swaying figure of the
Count de Varney, who had died horribly of slow
strangulation!</p>

<p>&#8220;The trial was long, for that part of the world. The
scandal was great, the mock-marriage being scoffed at
and Madame Miriam de B&mdash;&mdash; treated simply as an
adventuress. The will in her favor told against her
greatly, but, to the stupefaction of every one, the valet
defended her&mdash;swearing <i>he</i> had seen his master before
his mistress had&mdash;that he was <i>dead before she entered
the room</i>&mdash;that he had gone for help, not wishing to
touch the body without a witness being present, etc.
She swore that her husband was dead when she found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
him&mdash;but without the valet she would certainly have
been condemned to long, long imprisonment at the very
least. She lives under an assumed name now, and just
wanders over the world, as houseless as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Third act; everybody ready!&#8221; shouted the call-boy.</p>

<p>I looked about in a bewildered way for my fan and
my handkerchief, and went to my place on the stage,
saying to myself: &#8220;I will not look that way again
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The third act was known, in theatrical parlance, as
the strong act of the play. In it I had to attempt to
poison my rival, who had formerly been my beloved
friend, and at the very last moment, when the poison
was at her very lips, with a strong revulsion of feeling,
I had to snatch it away and swallow it myself, and then
proceed with the death scene, which naturally followed.</p>

<p>I had kept my promise; I had not looked once
toward the stage-box. I had worked myself well into
my character again and was doing my best to be <i>it</i>, and
not myself. That night I had just reached my half
unconscious victim and was cautiously raising the poisoned
drink to her lips, when some absolutely <i>outside</i>
power dragged my unwilling eyes from her face and
left me staring straight into the eyes of the woman
&#8220;who had been tried for her life&#8221;!</p>

<p>The actress beside me wondered what had happened&mdash;what
I had forgotten! No fly enmeshed in spider&#8217;s
web was ever held more helplessly than I was held for
a moment&#8217;s time by that devilish face, leaning from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
shadow of the curtained box. Strained and eager, it
was white as chalk. The lips were parted&mdash;the nostrils
quivering&mdash;while her thunderous brows frowned fiercely
above the cruel eyes that held me! And while I looked,
so surely as ever Murder raised its head to look through
human eyes, so surely Murder triumphant looked at me
through hers!</p>

<p>The actress at my side made a faint movement;
the spell was broken! I gave the shuddering cry
that belonged to the situation, and raising the glass
to my own lips, quickly swallowed the poison, and at
the very moment of so doing, from the private box, low,
but perfectly distinct, came the contemptuous words:
&#8220;You fool! You fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>I went on with my scene and ended the play.</p>

<p>At the end no sign of approbation came from the
private box. With some irritation, I asked myself if
she expected me to change the action of a play to
gratify her savage taste?</p>

<p>The box was what is called a &#8220;stage-box,&#8221; and it is
generally held by the manager for his family, or for
visiting artists, as it is apt to open just inside the stage
door. As I approached, I saw the box door open.
Two or three steps led up to it. At the foot of them
stood the young lady who had told me the story, and
who was the hostess of Madame de B&mdash;&mdash;. She saw me
and called: &#8220;Madame wishes to see you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame de B&mdash;&mdash; looked her name&mdash;Miriam&mdash;as
she stood there. Her stately figure was so beautiful, her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
face so calm and handsome&mdash;but I shrank from her
now; I could not forget the face I had seen but a few
moments ago. She stood at the top of the steps; I was
one step lower, while her young hostess waited at the
door. She did not speak. I noted the elegance of her
gown, and followed the movement of her white,
ungloved hands as she raised some black lace to drape
about her head and shoulders&mdash;Spanish fashion&mdash;and
so I met her eyes, and instantly there was neither
theatre nor hostess&mdash;there was nothing&mdash;there was no
one, but just she and I. I set my teeth hard and bore
her look. A hot flush swept over me, then I felt my
eyebrows lifting of their own accord, a faint chill
crept slowly about the roots of my hair, and presently
I saw the evil, hot light glowing in her eyes again, and
dreading the coming of what I had seen there before,
I spoke suddenly, imploringly, and said: &#8220;O Madame,
<i>was</i> he dead, or <i>was</i> he alive, when you found him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips drew back in silent laughter, her eyes
danced in burning triumph: &#8220;<i>Alive! Alive!! Poor,
little fool! Alive!!</i>&#8221; and then she leaned over me, and
gripping me hard upon the shoulders, she looked deep
down into my eyes, and then she said slowly, with the
devil in her face: &#8220;I&mdash;wonder&mdash;what&mdash;became&mdash;of&mdash;that&mdash;devoted&mdash;valet?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed aloud, turned suddenly to gather up
her skirt, and I threw out my hand and felt my way
by the wall, down the steps, and so into my own dressing
room, where I burst into wild sobbing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>Two or three nights passed, and then my friend
remarked that dear, handsome Madame de B&mdash;&mdash; had
sailed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was funny,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the idea of asking you to
come to her box, and then never opening her lips to
you, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked stupidly at her: &#8220;Why, what do you
mean?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;You stood in the door all the
time&mdash;you must have heard her speaking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she never opened her lips&mdash;except when she
laughed, as you went out!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was sorely puzzled&mdash;until perhaps a week after&mdash;<i>apropos</i>
of nothing, my little chatter-box remarked:
&#8220;You know poor Madame de B&mdash;&mdash; was one of Count de
Varney&#8217;s nurses at the very first of their acquaintance.
He was a victim of insomnia. A doctor called the
Count&#8217;s attention to her. She used to make him sleep,
sometimes even against his will. The doctor said she
had most unusual <i>mesmeric</i> power.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We never spoke again of Madame de B&mdash;&mdash;, but
sometimes on an autumn night, dark and chill, with the
rain falling stealthily on the sodden leaves that give forth
no rustle when a cautious foot presses them, I have
caught myself repeating those ominous words: &#8220;I&mdash;wonder&mdash;what&mdash;became&mdash;of&mdash;that&mdash;devoted&mdash;valet?&#8221;
But now to that query there can be but one answer:
&#8220;In Paris suddenly, Madame de B&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no poetry in life to-day!&#8221; We were walking
down Euclid Avenue, and my friend had been
expressing her hot disapproval of many things in this
really excellent world of ours, ending with that youthfully
positive assertion: &#8220;There is no poetry in life
to-day!&#8221;</p>

<p>I mildly suggested that she might not recognize it as
poetry, if she saw it, as poems were not always bound
in white and silver nor yet in blue and gold&mdash;some,
indeed, never reaching the honor (?) of binding at all.</p>

<p>By the fierceness of her contempt for the opinion of
another, one could easily measure her utter inexperience,
but she finally closed her address by haughtily
informing me that she was not to be deceived by
&#8220;bindings&#8221;&mdash;that all poetry was sacred to her, whether
she found it in the polished, metrical form of verse, or
simply expressing itself in human action&mdash;but in these
days there was no poetry&mdash;conscious or unconscious&mdash;for&mdash;she
got no further; my fingers were on her wrist
in that unintentionally savage clutch that never fails to
secure immediate attention and later remembrance&mdash;and
I was whispering: &#8220;Look! Look well! at the old
man approaching!&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure, though, she needed no such reminder&mdash;no
one could help looking at him&mdash;and, at first glance,
only his snowy hair kept the laugh from one&#8217;s lips. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
well-grown boy of twelve would have been &#8220;mad as a
hopper&#8221; if he had not stood, at least, even in height
with this old, old man. His gait was half-trot, half-shuffling
walk, and his speed remarkable&mdash;but little as
he was, he leant forward in a peculiar way. His nationality,
after fifty-five unbroken years in America, was
stamped so clearly on face and figure that his tongue&#8217;s
thick, disobedient English was not needed to proclaim
him an ancient Dutchman. His garments would have
wrung laughter from a telegraph pole&mdash;the saddest
thing on earth. That his wife made his trousers there
could be no doubt, for if you looked at <i>them</i> only, you
could never tell which way the man was going to walk.
Then, short as his little legs were, his trouser-legs were
still shorter, while he could have stowed away quite a
nice, little outfit in that portion of them known as the
&#8220;slack.&#8221; This breadth of beam and shortness of keel
gave to the public gaze a generous margin of clean,
white stocking. His collar, which was an integral part
of his shirt&mdash;and not, to use his own words, &#8220;a flimsy-flamsy
yump-a-bout-ting what wont stay hitched!&#8221;&mdash;was
of immaculate whiteness, but utterly innocent of
starch, and on his venerable head he wore an antique,
&#8220;panama&#8221; hat. A Dutch friend, who cultivated
coffee, had picked this &#8220;panama&#8221; in Java, when it was
green&mdash;so to speak&mdash;and sent it here, and the older
citizens had, for twenty-odd years, watched its slow
ripening under the American sun&mdash;and in its wearer&#8217;s
eyes it had just reached its prime. Before the quaint,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
little body reached us, I whispered: &#8220;It is not poverty
that makes him dress like that&mdash;he owns the big
&#8216;Buckeye Block,&#8217; besides his dwelling-house up town,&#8221;
and I saw her eye renew its slackening hold on him, so
great is our unconscious deference to money that already
he seemed less grotesque to her, because she saw him
through the softening, yellow light his gold cast upon
him&mdash;and then he dragged off his well-ripened &#8220;panama,&#8221;
and stopped to tell me &#8220;youst how glad vas
he to see me!&#8221;</p>

<p>For he had entered this country j-less, and
j-less he remained, using y in place of j with such
smiling confidence that it was &#8220;all right&#8221; that no
one had the heart to sternly put him in the wrong by
correcting him. My wise, young friend smiled quite
brightly upon him, and when he had passed, demanded
of me all I knew about him, &#8220;because he was such a
dear&mdash;and so individual&mdash;you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>I assured her there was nothing to tell&mdash;that he was
simply an ignorant but honest man, who by the hardest
work and almost incredible economy had risen to
wealth, and she surprised me by replying &#8220;that there
was more than that in his face, even for her, a stranger,
to see&mdash;and what was the secret of the almost child-like
gentleness of his clear, blue eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon, we lunched in a quiet corner of a quiet
room and over many&mdash;too many&mdash;cups of coffee, I told
her that his name was Knights&mdash;Jacobus Knights&mdash;and
I had made his acquaintance while I was still so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
young that the salient features of my own personality
were the length of my braids and the whiteness of my
aprons. He used to rear vegetables and then sell them
from a cart, which he pushed when it was full and
dragged when it was empty. Being sent after him one
day by a lady, I called out lustily: &#8220;Boy&mdash;boy&mdash;you
boy! Stop&mdash;stop&mdash;I say!&#8221; thus making the mistake
that many an older and wiser person made daily, and
one that was greatly facilitated by the tailless jacket
and flat cap the little man wore. Really, it savored
of the uncanny to thus address a question to the back
of childhood and receive your answer from the unshaven
lip of maturity. He seemed to be quite used to the
error, and only laughed and said: &#8220;Dat is noddings&mdash;youst
noddings at all! Whad I make mit you&mdash;onion&mdash;squash&mdash;eh,
whad now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Two years later I came to live on S&mdash;&mdash; street, and
right opposite, little Mr. Knights had his little play-house
of a home, his doll of a blond baby, and his tremendous
wife. No, her size was not the result of comparison,
she was really a tremendously big woman, from
whose deep chest and strong, column-like throat there
issued the thin, little voice of a complaining, &#8220;cheeping&#8221;
chick too weak to break its imprisoning shell. She
was a spring of pure Dutch undefiled. Not one English
sentence could she command, but she was a friendly
creature, and hobnobbed deprecatingly but successfully
with her neighbors through the medium of a ponderous
but expressive and ever-smiling pantomime.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>Never were such workers known before. I doubt if
they could have recognized their own breakfast had they
met it, by daylight. Certainly they had, for at least
forty years, taken that meal by artificial light&mdash;candle
or oil, whichever was the cheaper. Any morning
between half-past four and five o&#8217;clock the neighbors
could see, through the dim light, a pretty little incident.
The cart, heavily laden, stood outside the gate; the small
pedler with the boy-body and the man-face, with a
broad, leather band or collar across his neck, hooked its
ends to the shafts of the cart, thus placing on his
shoulders part of the heavy weight and at the same
time causing the curious forward bend of body that
disfigured his walk to-day. When he was quite ready
for his start, the door opened and the big woman
appeared, holding in her brown arms a little, night-gowned
figure, its bare, pink feet curled up in her one
broad hand&mdash;baby dreams still lingering mistily in the
sleepy, blue eyes, and while one wee hand pushed back
impatiently the blond tangle of curls, the other one
tossed uncounted kisses to the father dimly seen, while
a sweet, bird-like voice cried: &#8220;Bye-bye, Papa! Bye-bye!
Ick lief dy! Bye-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>For this little one had the gift of tongues, and from
babyhood Dutch and English were simply convertible
terms with her&mdash;and the adoring father, with cap off, stood
and smiled, and smiled, and waved his earth-stained,
stumpy hand, and blessed her with all the tender Dutch
blessings that he knew, and then put on his cap&mdash;took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
up his load and started on the way that would have been
so hard, so ugly, but for those baby kisses that bloomed
like flowers on his path and sweetened all his day.
When he had gone quite out of sight the little Rosie
was returned to the great, Dutch bed to complete her
sleep, and in a few moments the mother was crouching
between the rows of vegetables, looking like a monster
toad, and was weeding&mdash;weeding&mdash;weeding, until with
almost breaking back she began to carry water and
sprinkle&mdash;sprinkle&mdash;sprinkle, and after that the household
tasks of other women began&mdash;washing&mdash;scrubbing&mdash;ironing&mdash;baking,
yet always and ever with it all,
there were little, white garments for Rosie, and time to
put them on, and when the child outgrew the vegetable
basket she had passed a great part of her life in, playing
with a few marigolds or a hollyhock flower&mdash;she
could not have salable ones like mignonette or pinks&mdash;the
mother feared many things&mdash;for, as &#8220;Little
Knights&#8221; (that was what the neighbors called him),
explained in slow, back-end-first sentences, the vegetable
basket arrangement had been very satisfactory to both
parties, and his wife could plant or hoe or weed without
anxiety, having simply to put out her hand now and
then and pull the basket after her. But now that was
all past, and his wife was &#8220;full up mit dem fears,&#8221; and
when questioned as to the nature of the fears that were
filling her up, his blue eyes seemed both surprised and
reproachful that they could not see for themselves the
possible dangers in small Rosie&#8217;s path. &#8220;In place of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
first,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;der was de cleanness&mdash;she mighd
get dirty de garden in! Den,&#8221; his eyes grew round at
that, &#8220;der vas de red-peppers&mdash;she might touch dem
and aftervards rup her sveet eyes!&#8221; but when at the
end of a long list of possibilities, he cried out: &#8220;Unt
dem pees&mdash;dem honey pees&mdash;what pite mit dere tails&mdash;suppose
dey make mit dere stingers on her? Ach Gott!
Ach Gott!&#8221; and, caught in a linguistic tangle, he fell
into deep Dutch, from which he emerged breathless and
excited. Now that is a condition no Dutchman will
endure, so without apology, he trotted off home to soothe
himself with the one smoke he allowed himself each day,
and then to&mdash;rest? Oh, no, there was much work done
in that small house by night as well as by day&mdash;and
mind, there are old neighbors still to support
this statement&mdash;they used actually to work in
the garden by moonlight&mdash;not habitually, but
often enough, Heaven knows! And what was the
object of all this ceaseless labor&mdash;of their astonishing
economies?</p>

<p>Before the coming of their baby girl, they had been
little more than two patient, dumb beasts of burden.
Born and bred to work&mdash;they worked&mdash;but dully&mdash;without
hope or special object&mdash;but when God had sent
into their lives that laughing, pretty thing, and formed
her delicately that she might arouse their tenderness,
they had changed. They looked at one another, and
each, smiling, saw the other anew. They dreamed for
her&mdash;they hoped now for her&mdash;they prayed now heavy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
laborious, loving prayers for her. Truly she had been
the &#8220;locust and wild honey&#8221; that fed them in their
wilderness&mdash;so now it was for her they labored and were
therefore never tired.</p>

<p>As the years passed I, who had long since ceased to
live in S&mdash;&mdash; street, often went there to visit my friends
who had remained, stopping with them from Saturday
till Monday, and these visits kept me still in touch with
&#8220;Little Knights&#8221; and his idol. It seemed strange that
Rosie was quite unspoiled by so much adulation. She
was a favorite with all the neighbors, was polite and
obedient outside her own domain, while within it, an
absolute monarch, she ruled with gentlest strength her
idolatrous subjects. Derision or contempt shown to
them was swiftly and sharply resented by her, while the
only time she had to sternly exert her authority was
when she made some demand upon the treasury that was
for <i>their</i> benefit instead of hers.</p>

<p>The Knights&#8217; Sunday went like this: When it was
time for Sunday-school the front door opened (mind
you, in any other family of like position in life, that
door would have opened for only one of three things&mdash;a
wedding, a funeral, or the first visit of the clergyman,
so think how they honored that mere child)&mdash;then
big Mrs. Knights appeared and brushed the step over
with a cloth and retired from view (a pause), then little
Rosie appeared, balancing a moment on the step like
one of her own pet, white doves, her many short skirts
and her white dress starched to the uttermost limit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
rattling stiffness, open-work white stockings and black
slippers, with an ankle strap fastened with a gold button,
a broad, pink sash about her waist, pink ribbon
bows on each long, blond braid, a big leghorn hat
secured first by an elastic band, and over that by broad,
pink ribbons tied in a large bow under her milk-white
chin. In her little, mitted hands she held a testament,
and from between its leaves peeped a pink or a rose&mdash;a
handkerchief the size of a large postage stamp finished
her outfit&mdash;and so, gravely and with great propriety,
she came down the narrow path between the
&#8220;flox&#8221; and &#8220;sweet-william,&#8221; the &#8220;larkspur&#8221; and &#8220;four
o&#8217;clocks,&#8221; and all the horde of strong-growing, free-blooming
flowers of the poor&mdash;herself the daintiest
flower of them all&mdash;and at the gate she turned and
kissed her hand to the two heads thrust out at either
side of the door&mdash;the fresh-shaven face of her father
low down on one side, the broad-smiling face of her
mother high up on the other&mdash;then walked sedately
on towards the church, while behind her, the heads
gone, the door closed, seemingly of its own volition&mdash;to
open no more until the next week.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mrs. Knights appeared at the
side door where there was a tiny, <i>tiny</i> little platform,
with &#8220;scarlet-beans&#8221; trained thickly over its morsel of
roof. On this porch one chair was carefully placed on
Sunday mornings and occupied by Mrs. Knights,
arrayed in a white petticoat and white bedgown (as
the short, loose garment was called). Her hair was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
oiled and brushed to a glassy smoothness, a big horn-comb
loomed high above her head, and a pair of gold
ear-drops, that seemed to have been sold by the yard,
dangled from her ears. Her tired, old feet rested in a
huge pair of braided list shoes that looked like boats.
Once seated, &#8220;Little Knights&#8221; trotted out with a Bible
of a size so prodigious one wondered how it ever found
a resting place inside that little bit of a house. Its
mighty clasps undone, he placed it on his wife&#8217;s lap,
and then made another trip and brought out a great
pair of spectacles, framed in silver, which he solemnly
fitted on her nose, then most carefully and cautiously
he adapted himself to such narrow margin of floor
space as was left for him, and their service began.</p>

<p>It was with a rather wavering, quavering rendering
of an old hymn, after which Mrs. Knights opened
the book, and looking over the tops of her glasses&mdash;she
could not see a word through them, but she felt they
loaned her a certain dignity as of office&mdash;she found the
place, and by the aid of one blunt finger (its stained,
cracked nail worn down to the very quick), she made
her way with pathetic slowness across the page of
frenzied Dutch print. Not that they doubted the
saving-power of the English Bible for the English and
incidentally for the American sinner, but they felt
that their own sins were so peculiarly Dutch in quality
that nothing short of a Dutch Bible could save them.
Wherefore, Mrs. Knights, each Sunday, with blunt
forefinger seemed to dig out words of Holy-writ from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
the great book, while her small husband carefully stored
them in the basket of his memory.</p>

<p>After the chapter had come to its laborious close,
they both took breath and wiped their dripping brows,
then clasped their hands, bowed their heads and offered
each a silent prayer. I had once come upon them so,
the bees circling about their gray, old heads, while their
prayers, like the perfume of two souls mingling with
the perfume of the flowers, rose through the warm
air, straight to that great God who had given them
Rosie.</p>

<p>And that sweet name encompassed all of good his
life contained&mdash;health and strength, growing wealth
and the respect in which his neighbors held him, and
when he would have offered humble thanks for them,
instead he blessed God for Rosie.</p>

<p>With a slight trace of that peasant cunning which
had been his when the stocking-foot had been his only
bank, he tried to hide, as far as possible, his increasing
prosperity. He had long owned the double lot and
the toy house that made home for him, and it was whispered
that certain lots on the outskirts of the town, used
by &#8220;Little Knights&#8221; for a truck-garden, were really
his, though the wily Jacobus often, perhaps too often,
referred to the fact: &#8220;Dat he had paid de rent dem
gartens of!&#8221; However, the old neighbors to this day
tell a story of &#8220;Little Knights&#8221; touching upon his
secretiveness about money.</p>

<p>Rosie, who, by the way was Rosie to all the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
except her father&mdash;he called her ever and always his
Rose or his &#8220;Little Rose;&#8221; in babyhood, or in womanhood,
&#8220;My Rose&#8221; was the name he gave his idol!
When his Rose had reached the age of fourteen, she
stood before him one evening, holding a match to his
pipe, and when the tobacco glowed evenly all over,
she shut down the perforated silver cover, and said
suddenly: &#8220;Father, I wonder if you can be rich
enough to buy me something, an expensive something,
too, father?&#8221; and the old eyes had fairly danced, and
surely in that moment, Jacobus Knights tasted all the
sweetness of prosperity. Yet, Jacobus was a Dutchman,
and therefore cautious, and so assuming as much
doubt as was possible over so absolutely certain a
matter, he inquired as to the nature of &#8220;dis ting
vat made such expense mit itself,&#8221; and Rosie, with
clear eyes on his face, had answered with a little
tremble of anxiety in her voice: &#8220;A piano, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the small father had crushed back a smile, and
averted joyous eyes, and had basely suggested that an
accordeon &#8220;might answer youst as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>But clever Rosie noticed he said no word about not
affording it, so she instantly assumed a patient look of
endurance, saying: &#8220;No father, an accordeon will not
do; but never mind, I see you are not rich enough yet,
I can wait!&#8221; and he had hastily broken in on this
meekness with: &#8220;<i>You see, you see</i>, youst noddings, my
Rose! How many dimes a hunnert tollars, makes
dem bianos mit demselves, all mit der india-rupper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
overcoats on &#8217;em, too, unt lots of dat moosic pieces
sphilt all de top over? All&mdash;youst all de nice hair-horse
biano stools, too, vat twist round unt round, and
make you sick mit yourself&mdash;everyting vat goes dat biano
mit? <i>Dat</i> is, vat I come rich enough to give mit my
Rose!&#8221;</p>

<p>But imagine the stupefaction of every soul who knew
&#8220;Little Knights,&#8221; when two weeks later, without a word
of his intentions to anyone, he sent men to lay the foundation
of a new house on the next-door lot, which was
vacant; and to the excited inquiries of his neighbors he
<i>naively</i> replied, between puffs of smoke: &#8220;Vell, you
see now, my Rose, she vant dat biano, unt&mdash;(pause)&mdash;unt
I have to make first de house to put him in&mdash;don&#8217;t
you see mit me?&#8221; And the laugh that followed rolled
around the town and made him known far and wide as
the little, Dutch gardener who built a house for his
daughter&#8217;s piano.</p>

<p>A few more prosperous years and &#8220;Little Knights,&#8221;
who began to be called &#8220;Little Old Knights&#8221; now, was
watching, with proud eyes, the growing train of Rosie&#8217;s
lovers. She was a charming girl&mdash;clever, well-read, an
excellent musician, a perfect little housekeeper, and,
best of all, tenderly, bravely loyal to her big, illiterate
mother and her short-cut, old father.</p>

<p>She was a milk-white blond&mdash;a silvery, flaxen blond,
and though tints of mauve and clear, pure blue found
favor in her eyes, she still wore pink for her old father&#8217;s
sake. He had used to say of her in baby days: &#8220;My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Rose is such a vite, liddle Rose&mdash;I like dat she be tied
up pink ribbons mit&mdash;alvays mit pink!&#8221; So now, tied
up &#8220;mit pink,&#8221; she received her young friends in that
one-time &#8220;holy of holies&#8221;&mdash;the front room; now
termed parlor. With a sort of anguished pride big
Mrs. Knights saw sunlight streaming through only thin
lace curtains across the new carpet&mdash;saw other books
than the Bible and family album there&mdash;saw flowers and
open piano, and oh&mdash;oh&mdash;the chairs all pulled out from
their nice, straight rows against the wall! But then&mdash;ach
Gott! Rosie knew! And the ringing of the doorbell
was as music in the ears of the doting, old pair
who sat in the inner room&mdash;one knitting, the other
smoking&mdash;both nodding and smiling and putting severe
restraint upon themselves to keep from rushing in with
refreshments before greetings were hardly over.</p>

<p>That moment of offering refreshments was a moment
of joy and of torture. They would willingly have
effaced themselves from the life of their &#8220;American&#8221;
daughter (as they proudly called her), but she had neither
friend nor acquaintance who did not know&mdash;and through
her introduction&mdash;her father and mother. With regard
to the latter, Rosie had worked a miracle. In two years&#8217;
time, by faithful and almost desperate effort, she had
taught her mother nine simple English words. They
were evidently selected by the astute Rosie with a view
to future social requirements. So now Mrs. Knights
could, with portentous gasps and moistening brow, say:
&#8220;How do-do?&#8221; &#8220;Com&#8217; again!&#8221; &#8220;Good-bye!&#8221; &#8220;Ver&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
glad!&#8221; &#8220;Ver&#8217; sorry!&#8221; and &#8220;My!&#8221; And when the
moment came for the long-necked bottles of sparkling
German wine&mdash;the fruit&mdash;the sandwiches&mdash;the cream-cheese,
etc., to appear, the old pair, rejoicing in their
hospitality, swelling with pride in Rosie and Rosie&#8217;s
popularity, yet nearly crushed by embarrassment,
appeared, too. And Mrs. Knights&mdash;&#8220;How do-do?&#8221;
all round&mdash;wilted into a big chair in the corner, from
whence she smiled most happily and cast a &#8220;My!&#8221; of
excellent pronunciation into the general conversation
now and then, for which her Rosie gave her a dozen
kisses afterward.</p>

<p>The bright, laughing girl saw that her father had the
prettiest visitor in the room to sit by, and that her own
choice of the young men should wait upon her mother,
and so, with wonderful tact, she led them into her
brighter life, instead of shutting them out into the
shamed solitude known to so many lowly parents.
Rosie was nineteen when she made her choice. Young
Randall had been a child of wealth until, at twenty,
his father tried to &#8220;corner&#8221; something and had been
cornered himself and ruined. Then the boy went to
work and had been working for six years when he fell
in love with Rosie. Never had there been such excitement
in a Dutchman&#8217;s life before! Little Old Knights
was a house-building, present-buying, hand-rubbing,
amiable, little lunatic! His wife smiled in her very
sleep at night, and lived in her Dutch receipt-book all
day, while Rosie had to watch the pair with the eyes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
an affectionate lynx to prevent them from buying horse-hair
furniture for her future parlor, and large chunks of
amethyst or big, diamond-set things for ornaments.</p>

<p>But she managed so well that only a few atrocities
crept in among her gifts, and her little home was charming.
Many thought that now, as Rosie entertained a
good deal and had new friends in her new home, she
would ignore the old folks. Not she! Whenever she
had anything &#8220;on,&#8221; from a &#8220;coffee-drinking&#8221; to an
&#8220;evening party,&#8221; she flew down to the old home and
laced her mother into shape, crowding her into a stiff,
silk gown, that creaked at each labored breath of its
wearer, and when she was in full panoply of war, and
Little Old Knights had been turned about and looked
over as if he were a boy getting ready for Sunday-school,
Rosie kissed them both and took them off to her own
home, and set them down in two big chairs with a little
table between them, for their spectacles and handkerchiefs
and other small belongings&mdash;and there, like an old
pair of children, they sat and enjoyed all that went on;
and when there was dancing, &#8220;Old Knights&#8221; never
failed to indulge in one waltz with his ancient wife&mdash;the
memory of whose youth must have gone into her
feet to make her so light on them still. And while
Rosie joined in the laughter this waltz always aroused,
there would be a tremor in her voice and she would
hold her young husband&#8217;s hand close and whisper:
&#8220;Will you love <i>me</i> like that, Hal, when I have grown
old?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>So on radiant wings time flew by, until one morning
neighbors heard laughing in &#8220;Little Knights&#8217;&#8221; garden&mdash;laughing
that continued and continued, and when they
went over, &#8220;Little Knights&#8221; was doing the laughing,
with tears running down his cheeks and falling on the
prodigious Bible open on his short knees. When questioned,
he exclaimed: &#8220;She has kom&#8217;&mdash;all safe, she
has kom&#8217;! I seen her mit mine eyes&mdash;I have tooched
her mit dese fingers! De liddle daughter of mine own
Rose! Ach, de Almighty Gott is a most goot Gott!&#8221;
and then he bowed his white head and muttered: &#8220;Now
let Thy servant depart mit peace!&#8221; And so poor,
&#8220;Little Old Knights&#8221; found his cup of joy full to the
brim!</p>

<p>And what happens to any cup held in human hands
if filled to the brim? It runs over&mdash;and there is cruel
loss! And so it came to pass that Rosie&#8217;s little one
stayed with them just long enough to smile a recognition
of her girlish mother&#8217;s face, and then some sweet,
strong call came from the &#8220;beyond&#8221; that baby had
heard and answered&mdash;and they were left to wonder at
the awful void that small absence made in all their
lives.</p>

<p>Poor, Old Knights! Tight in his arms he held the
tiny, coffined dead&mdash;moaning over and over: &#8220;My liddle
pud&mdash;my Rose&#8217;s liddle pud!&#8221;&mdash;until that sad
moment when, by sheer force, they took the wee, dead
thing from him, to hide it away beneath the flowers and
the grasses.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>Time passed slowly now. Rosie, very gentle&mdash;very
tender of others&mdash;was sad, so sad. That was not natural
to her&mdash;so all rejoiced when hope once more shone
in her face&mdash;and all was thankful when Little Old
Knights trotted from door to door with the news that
his Rose had &#8220;anodder liddle daughter&mdash;so like&mdash;ach
Gott! so like de first&mdash;as never yet dey saw!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie&#8217;s joy was great, but it was not the laughing,
unthinking joy of other days. She felt anxieties and
fears. She dreaded this and that, but her silvery blond
baby was so strong and well, and grew so fast, and
&#8220;crowed&#8221; and laughed, and romped with father and
grandfather, and stood so strong upon her little legs
that fears had to give way to confidence, and her heart
bounded with triumph when she heard the baby voice,
cry imperatively; &#8220;Ma&mdash;ma! ma&mdash;ma!&#8221;</p>

<p>One day in particular Rosie always remembered&mdash;she
had toiled for a good hour at training baby to say:
&#8220;Pa&mdash;pa,&#8221; when the father had come from the office&mdash;and
when he came the baby had stretched out her
arms to him, looked back roguishly at Rosie, and then
fairly screamed: &#8220;Ma&mdash;ma! ma&mdash;ma!&#8221; and they had
all laughed and laughed! Good God! how easy it is
for a baby to fill a happy home with merriment! And
that very night &#8220;croup&#8221; had clutched with murderous
fingers the little throat that was used to swell with
laughter as a bird&#8217;s throat swells with song&mdash;and darkness
and silence came upon the house.</p>

<p>Little Knights&mdash;poor, broken, Little Knights&mdash;like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
small, gray shadow, flitted back and forth between the
two stricken homes. At one moment he had blasphemed
in his misery. His Rose had been lying on his
breast and she had wrung her hands and lifted her tortured
eyes to his and cried: &#8220;Father, what have I
done? Think back&mdash;think hard! What wickedness
did I do, that God should punish me so cruelly? Did
I lie? Did I bear false witness against anyone? Think
father&mdash;think for me, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he had lifted up his voice against Almighty
God and cursed his work&mdash;and now he remembered his
words and shivered, for, with creeping horror, he felt
that there was something approaching him more terrible
even than the loss of the second little bud of love
and hope&mdash;Rose! Rose&mdash;his worshiped Rose&mdash;who
wept not&mdash;who thought no more for others&#8217; comforts&mdash;who
sat motionless for long hours at a time, had
been taken possession of by a grotesquely horrible idea
that the husband she loved so was trying to put her
legally away, because her children died! And she
would hold his hands and beg piteously that he should
wait for her to die!&mdash;that she would not be long about
it now! And the poor husband would kneel at her
feet and pour out his love and grief, but all in vain!</p>

<p>Then she would lay her head on &#8220;Little Knights&#8217;&#8221;
breast and tell him to take her away before the new
wife came! He felt what was coming, and believed
<i>his</i> blasphemy had brought destruction upon her when
his Rose became quite mad! At first he tried to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
his life, but Mrs. Knights seemed to have eyes all over&mdash;he
could not escape them. Then, suddenly, he cast
himself&mdash;helpless, hopeless, almost heartbroken, at the
&#8220;Blessed Feet,&#8221; asking nothing for himself, but
entreating mercy for his Rose!&mdash;so innocent, so good!
Bye and bye he ceased to bargain with the Lord, and
bowed his head, and with grief-shaken voice, said simply:
&#8220;Thy will, not mine, O Gott!&#8221; and straight a
gleam of sunlight came back into his life. Rose&mdash;his
beloved Rose&mdash;had recovered her reason! &#8220;Little
Knights&#8221; held her in his arms and kissed the weary
eyes and drooping lips&mdash;and blessed God for her! but
knew in his heart he would never again see his white
Rose &#8220;tied up mit pink ribbons.&#8221;</p>

<p>And time goes on and on, and Rose, gentle, kind, a
very angel of mercy to the poor, devoted to her husband
and her parents&mdash;rarely smiling&mdash;never laughing&mdash;shivers
at the sight of a blond baby. Four years
had passed after her second loss, and her silence was
deceiving them all. I think, when one Sunday in
church a strange, little, restless creature in her pew
crept along the seat and put its baby hand on hers, and
poor Rosie at that touch had fainted dead away, after
that they understood.</p>

<p>One day I saw &#8220;Little Knights&#8221; standing uncovered
at the side of two tiny graves. A small white
stone at their head had carved upon it two rosebuds
and beneath, three words, clear and plain: &#8220;Our little
buds!&#8221; I murmured the words half aloud, and &#8220;Little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
Knights,&#8221; with tears on his cheeks, said: &#8220;Yays, yays&mdash;youst
liddle puds&mdash;but, oh, whad sweet, liddle puds
dey were! Gott give me youst von Rose&mdash;full bloomed
unt perfect&mdash;but dese puds? <i>No! no!</i> He say dey
may not bloom here!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up into the clear, far, far blue, and
smiled and nodded, and said, very low: &#8220;Oop dere&mdash;I
think He make &#8217;em bloom out full&mdash;dem puds! I like
I can see dat! I don&#8217;t want to leaf my Rose&mdash;I stay
here as long as she stay&mdash;but I vant so much to see my
liddle puds bloom!&#8221; and then he placed on each wee
grave a beautiful rosebud, and trotted away home to his
good, old wife and his adored Rosie!</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; I added, &#8220;this is Saturday&mdash;is it not?
Well, to-morrow, before four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon,
should you go to W&mdash;&mdash; Cemetery, you would see the
&#8216;little hop o&#8217; my thumb&#8217; I pointed out to you a while
ago come trotting in, holding two beautiful, exquisitely
beautiful, rosebuds in his hand; would see him make
his way to those two tiny graves, and without shame,
fall on his knees, and with one arm stretched across
the graves, humbly pray. Then kissing both buds, he
would place one on each grave&mdash;then, with falling tears,
leave the cemetery&mdash;and that has been done and will
be done, winter as well as summer, by this poor, faithful
&#8216;Little Old Knights.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at my companion and was amazed to see her
eyes were brimming, and as she dashed the tears away,
the shameless little turncoat cried&mdash;&#8220;And do you now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
tell me you can&#8217;t see poetry in life&mdash;when you have
known a man like that? Why, there is all the poetry
of &#8216;fatherhood&#8217; right before your eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>And to this day she wonders why I laughed so long
and heartily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Ambition of MacIlhenny</h2>
</div>


<p>After mentioning that last name it seems like rank
waste of time to say his first name was Sandy. He
couldn&#8217;t help it, his parents couldn&#8217;t help it, no one
could help it; one name follows the other naturally.</p>

<p>Well, then, being Sandy MacIlhenny, of course he
was Scotch. I mention it for mere form&#8217;s sake, as you
knew it beforehand, just as you knew what his first
name was. But, fortunately for us all, he had lived in
America so many years that he had lost or thrown
away his dialect, and the only thing in his speech that
could suggest his native heath was the marked preference
for the letter &#8220;u&#8221; instead of &#8220;i&#8221; in whisky,
(and I think, myself, &#8220;whusky&#8221; has a more filling
sound) and a &#8220;burring,&#8221; a b&#8217;r&#8217;r&#8217;r to his &#8220;r&#8217;s,&#8221; as
though a very large, bewildered &#8220;bumble-bee&#8221; were
blundering about the end of his broad tongue, and
then bumping back to the roof of his mouth.</p>

<p>Poor MacIlhenny&#8217;s life was a tragedy, and yet it was
played, to the very last act, to an accompaniment of
jeers and laughter&mdash;not malicious, not bitter, but
simple, thoughtless laughter.</p>

<p>A description of his personal appearance might, I
think, go a good way toward explaining the cause of
that general laughter. Had he been simply ugly,
all had been well&mdash;there&#8217;s nothing injurious in ugliness;
it may even be a power. He was worse than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
that. In our English language there is a word that
may have been created at the very moment of Sandy&#8217;s
birth, for the express use of those wishing to describe
him perfectly but briefly&mdash;that word is &#8220;grotesque.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was tall, very tall, with a sudden, rounding droop
of the shoulders that gave him the look of a button-hook
or interrogation point, while his thickness through
the body was about that of a choice, salt codfish. If
he was furnished with the usual number of internal
organs they must have been pressed like autumn leaves
in a dictionary, or else he did not wear them all at one
time; that&#8217;s how thin he was. Then he was the only
tall man I ever saw pacing through life on bowed-legs.
No, not knock-kneed! Sandy&#8217;s legs were bowed to a
roundness that let one see, at a glance, just how a
picture of certain portions of the landscape would look
in a perfectly round frame. No man on earth could
command respect while standing on a pair of legs like
Sandy&#8217;s, unless they were concealed beneath the protecting
petticoat of church or college. He had very
high cheek-bones, across which the skin was drawn so
tightly that they looked like a pair of unexpected
knuckles. His chin was long and straight, without the
slightest indentation or curve about it. His nose
shared in the general lengthiness and was thin and
pointed, while, owing to the narrowness of his entire
structural plan, each small, greenish-blue eye turned
inwardly and gazed with fixed resentment at the intervening
bridge that seemed to be crowding them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>And these cruelly crossed eyes made MacIlhenny a
veritable joy to the street boys, who would follow him,
performing warlike dances, and then rush before him
and wait at street corners with ostentatiously crossed
forefingers between which they gravely spat to avert
the ill-luck his glance might put upon them.</p>

<p>Poor man! In no limb, no feature had he been spared&mdash;so
that the final touch of common, coarse ugliness
was found in the shining baldness of the top of his
head, and the little flounce of brick-red hair with which
he seemed to be modestly trying to cover its startling
nudity.</p>

<p>With such a body to dwell in, one can hardly wonder
that his mind should become distorted and develop
only in one direction, as it were, and such a direction,
for the ambition of MacIlhenny, this poor, cross-eyed,
bowlegged Scotchman of the lower laboring class&mdash;this
excellent cutter of stone, was to be the greatest
<i>tragic-actor</i> of his day!</p>

<p>Nor was his ambition of the mere &#8220;I wish I were!&#8221;
or &#8220;I would like to be!&#8221; order. It was a devouring
passion.</p>

<p>A strong word, &#8220;devouring,&#8221; but since Webster
says it means, among other things, &#8220;to consume ravenously,
to prey upon, to swallow up, to appropriate
greedily,&#8221; it is the right word, for his mad ambition,
even in its beginning, appropriated greedily all his
small savings, all his spare time. It consumed his
sense of duty toward his wife&mdash;he had no sense of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
ridiculous to consume. It preyed upon his heart as
well as his mind, and finally it swallowed up his very
life.</p>

<p>Many of the old acting plays he knew by heart, had
memorized literally from cover to cover, while his
knowledge of Shakespeare&#8217;s unacted plays was greater
than most actors&#8217; knowledge of the acting ones. Quite
naturally he was given over to the habit of quoting, in
season and out of season, and it was an indulgence in
this habit that brought the stonecutter into touch with
the actors of the city.</p>

<p>There was a saloon not far from the theatre, and
MacIlhenny, being at work near by, went in one noon
for his mid-day beer. There was a party of actors
there eagerly discussing the morning news of the death
of one of their profession, a very well known and
successful actor. Now, as they all knew, one of this
party had been the envious enemy of the dead man,
and now, instead of a respectful silence, they were
astonished to see him assuming deep grief. There was
a great pulling of moustaches and exchanging of
glances, but no one replied, and the hypocrite burst
out again, first with fulsome praise, and then with
exaggerated expressions of sorrow. The last word was
barely spoken, when a voice with a burr in it gravely
and most distinctly remarked: &#8220;The tears live in an
onion that should water this sorrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an instant of surprised silence, in which
every one recognized the exquisite fitness of the quotation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
and then a roar of laughter&mdash;another and
another! Many beers were thrust upon the Scotch
stonecutter, who knew his Shakespeare so well&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;oh!
poor MacIlhenny! Straightway he neglected
his work; he loitered too long at his nooning.
He could not tear himself away from the actors, who
listened to his quotations and laughed at his antics, as
children might laugh at the capers of a monkey. But
MacIlhenny left them with a wild gleam in his poor,
crossed eyes, with jumping, twitching muscles about
his thin lips, fairly drunk with excitement.</p>

<p>It was on one of these occasions that he saw his
landlord ahead of him in the public street&mdash;a rotund,
little person who seemed to have had one story left off
when he was built. He knew it, too, and tried, with
piled up dignity and high silk hat, to make up the
missing height. And it was to this dignified, black-croated,
slow-moving, old gentleman that MacIlhenny
roared: &#8220;Turn, hell-hound, turn! Turn, I say!
I want to hand you me month&#8217;s rent and save a trip
to your house to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was one of his out of season quotations, for the
dignified old party was no hell-hound, but MacIlhenny
had just been discussing Macbeth, and showing how
poorly Mr. Booth understood that character, admitting
that the &#8220;laddie did his best, and meant well, still he
(MacIlhenny) was the one man living who had got
<i>inside</i> the part&#8221;!</p>

<p>Well along in the season, one of the actors was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
take a benefit, and as he was not much of a favorite
with the public, he was greatly worried about arranging
an attractive &#8220;bill.&#8221; Perhaps I should say that
when one takes &#8220;a benefit&#8221; the fact is announced on
the theatre&#8217;s bills. The &#8220;beneficiary&#8221; has the privilege
of selecting the play for that special performance,
and on that one night, he or she receives one-half, or
one-third of the gross receipts of the house, by which
he is benefited (perhaps), hence the term, &#8220;To take a
benefit!&#8221;</p>

<p>A couple of weeks before, at the &#8220;leading&#8221; man&#8217;s
benefit, there had been several volunteers, among them
the manager&#8217;s young daughter, who sang for him, and
in MacIlhenny&#8217;s presence, the worried actor was
mourning because there was no one to volunteer to
assist him, when up rose Sandy MacIlhenny and
offered <i>his</i> services. Those who were farthest away
writhed in quiet laughter, while those who were near
him suffered silently. In that silence the stonecutter
read dread of a rival, and he hastened to dispel all
anxiety by saying, soothingly: &#8220;Don&#8217;t misunderstand
me, young man! You have nothing to fear! I do
not ask to play a &#8216;part&#8217; in your play&mdash;since the
public could then have neither eye nor ear for any man
but me&mdash;and I&#8217;d not extinguish anyone&#8217;s light on his
benefit&mdash;but I&#8217;ll do a recitation or a reading-like, for
you&mdash;so &#8216;Put money in thy purse, Cassio,&#8217; and not
injure your standing as an actor!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a trying moment. They liked the funny, old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
chap, and did not wish to hurt his feelings&mdash;but good
Heavens! the idea of turning him loose before an
audience! Again came the voice of MacIlhenny, with
the inevitable quotation: &#8220;Why whisper you&mdash;and
answer not, my lords?&#8221;</p>

<p>A laugh followed, and the tormented actor asked:
&#8220;Well, Sandy man, what on earth do you propose to
read or recite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; answered he, &#8220;since you will be doing a
tragedy, and I have no wish to outshine you in any
way, I&#8217;ll just give them the &#8216;Trial Scene&#8217; from
&#8216;Pickwick.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the storm of merriment that followed one
or two voices cried: &#8220;Let him do it! Let him do it!
It will be great!&#8221; And just then, at the glass door of
the saloon, a tall, gaunt woman appeared. She was
one of that body of black-bombazine women who are
never ragged, but are always rusty&mdash;who all appear
of the same age, as they all seem to have passed with
reluctant feet their fiftieth birthday. She tapped with
a black cotton forefinger on the glass, and MacIlhenny
went to her at once, and spoke with her a few moments&mdash;and
one exclaimed: &#8220;The Two Dromios!&#8221; For
indeed had it not been for her straight eyes, she might
have been Sandy&#8217;s twin. When he returned some one
said: &#8220;Your wife, MacIlhenny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; he said, &#8220;aye&mdash;and though I don&#8217;t claim
she&#8217;s a beauty, yet &#8216;I&#8217;ll give no blemish to her honor&mdash;none!&#8217;&#8221;
At which they howled with delight, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
when they were tired of pounding one another, the
voice arose again: &#8220;Let him go on&mdash;oh, let him go
on!&#8221; and another added: &#8220;Yes, let him go on, just
to see how many he&#8217;ll kill before he gets off again!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it happened that Sandy MacIlhenny, stonecutter
by the grace of God, became, by the cruel whim
of man, an actor, and was duly announced on the
&#8220;benefit-bills&#8221; to read the &#8220;Trial Scene&#8221; from
&#8220;Pickwick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas, &#8220;those whom the Gods will destroy, they first
make mad!&#8221; It is an ancient promise, and so truly
was it kept with this their chosen victim, that on the
dark and fatal night that was the beginning of the
end for him, poor MacIlhenny saw the radiant dawn
of a superb success.</p>

<p>The night came, and a fairly good-sized audience
was present. Sandy&#8217;s reading was placed between the
first and second plays, and a more ludicrous figure never
appeared before the public. By some mysterious process
he had forced his widely bowed-legs into a pair of
very narrow, straight-cut trousers. They were of an
unsympathetic nature, and as he wore low-cut shoes,
they basely betrayed about two inches of white, womany-looking
stockings, thus giving a strong suggestion of
impropriety to his whole &#8220;make-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>His &#8220;wescut,&#8221; as he called it, he had brought, as he
proudly declared, from Scotland, and the actors, as
with one voice, had cried: &#8220;It looks the part, Sandy,
it looks it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>It was a short-waisted, low-necked vest of a plaid
(of course) of red and green and blue and yellow, and
the greatest of these was red, and it was velvet, and it
had two crowded rows of shining, brass buttons. With
quite unnecessary candor, his shirt proclaimed, through
dragging wrinkle and straggling band, that it was of
domestic manufacture; while an ancient black satin
stock nearly choked the life out of him. And his
hair&mdash;oh, Sandy, Sandy! His wife had curled it on
a very small iron, and had then drawn the comb
through it, thus setting it a-flying in a wild, red fuzz
on whose edges the gaslight glittered, until he looked
like some absurd, old Saint with his halo falling off
backward!</p>

<p>As this figure of fun appeared, there was a ripple of
laughter, and in a few minutes&mdash;in the expressive slang
of to-day&mdash;the audience were &#8220;on&#8221; to him. The
laughter grew and grew&mdash;and then that strange <i>strain</i>
of cruelty, that has come down to us from our ancient
barbaric forefathers, and is so much easier to arouse
in a crowd than in a single individual, was all alive.
They thought they recognized a victim, and they rose
to the occasion. They <i>baited</i> him; they bombarded
him with satirical applause; they demanded certain
passages over again; they addressed him as Mr. Buz-fuz,
and they had just reached the point of throwing
things when the reading ended.</p>

<p>As MacIlhenny had no sense of the ridiculous, he
could not distinguish the difference between being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
laughed <i>at</i> and being laughed <i>with</i>, so it was all like
fragrant incense to him, and he came off the stage, his
crossed eyes blazing at the bridge of his nose, on each
cheek bone a spot of scarlet and a burr on his tongue
that made his first words of triumph utterly incomprehensible
to those about him. Two of us there were who
drew aside, and pitying him, spoke him fair and respectfully,
but the others, meaning no harm, carrying on a
jest, congratulated him extravagantly, and when he went
out from the theatre that night the promise of the gods
had been fulfilled, for MacIlhenny was literally mad!</p>

<p>He never did another stroke of work. His kit of
tools became strangers to him. He touched chisel and
mallet but once more, and that was when he pawned
them that he might buy a play-book, and a little bread,
with which to quiet for a moment the two devils who
tormented him, one gnawing in his brain, the other at
his stomach.</p>

<p>In going to and from the theatre I passed the tiny,
three-roomed cottage the MacIlhennys occupied, and
morning and evening I could hear his high, rasping
voice declaiming, ranting, pouring forth pages of old
plays, while through the window I could see him
brandishing a poker for a sword, and wildly rumpling
his little, red flounce of hair whenever he pronounced
a curse&mdash;whether he was Lear or Richelieu or Sir
Giles, it mattered not, he dragged all curses from the
roots of his thin, red hair.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Sandy had descended from her former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
state of bombazine, and was daily seen in black cotton,
going out to jobs of washing or office-cleaning, so her
neighbors told me. And once, when they missed her
comfortable blanket-shawl and noticed that she
shivered through the streets in an old Stella shawl,
which was a creation of thin cashmere meant for
summer only, they rashly spoke the sympathy they
felt, and their condemnation of MacIlhenny&#8217;s course.</p>

<p>It was the first time and likewise it was every other
time, including the <i>last</i> time they so presumed. She
listened in stony silence, and then with bitter pride
and icy resentment in every look and word, she
demanded: &#8220;What else shall my man do? Is it for
the like of him to be pounding stone forever, and he
the finest actor-man in all the world to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Mrs. MacIlhenny was a Presbyterian of a
blueness like unto indigo, and of a narrowness inconceivable&mdash;who
have never in her life entered a theatre.
Therefore it was but natural that one of the surprised
women should ask: &#8220;But how do you know that?&#8221;
And she made answer&mdash;oh! loving, loyal, old Scottish
wife&mdash;with withering scorn and infinite conviction:
&#8220;Why, has the man na&#8217; telled me so hissel&#8217;?&#8221; and
so went her hard way.</p>

<p>For many weeks MacIlhenny had made the
manager&#8217;s life a burden to him&mdash;asking, praying,
demanding an engagement. &#8220;Why, man,&#8221; he would
say, &#8220;did you not see the public at my very feet&mdash;did
you not hear their acclamations, and you know right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
well that in the absence of garlands and flowers they
would have tossed to me anything their hands came
upon? What are you afraid of? The enmity of your
wee bit stars! I&#8217;ll see that you suffer no loss!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then steady disappointment told upon him. His
temper began to change&mdash;he grew sullen, suspicious,
and began to tell strange tales of being followed at
night by certain actors&mdash;generally stars. No man
could call Sandy MacIlhenny a sponge or beat. When
he reached the point where he could not extend
a general invitation to those present to drink&mdash;he
ceased to share in the general invitations of others.
And when he could no longer pay his own footing, he
no longer entered the saloon, but loitered outside to
talk to the actors. Imagining things were not well
with him, the actor for whom MacIlhenny had read
asked him to accept some payment, but with ever-ready
quotation, Sandy refused, gravely repeating:
&#8220;There&#8217;s none can truly say he gives&mdash;if he receives!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then even the outside visits grew far apart, and
through my passing of his door I was the only one
who knew anything of him, and I knew so little, dear
Heaven! so little! Only that he studied, rehearsed,
declaimed! I did not know how many, <i>many</i> days
passed without bringing Mrs. Sandy any job of work,
and their pride-sealed lips made no complaint. The
old Scotch couple were not unlike a pair of sharp, old
razors&mdash;perfectly harmless if left alone in their own
case, but very unsafe things for general handling&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
so in the midst of plenty, they suffered the pangs&mdash;the
gnawing pangs&mdash;of hunger for weary days and
wearier nights, and no one knew!</p>

<p>One spring-like day, as I passed the cottage&mdash;the
window being raised&mdash;I heard MacIlhenny&#8217;s voice at
some distance, and recognized the lines of Woolsey in
Henry VIII.: &#8220;Had I but served my God, with half
the zeal that I have served&mdash;have served&mdash;,&#8221; he
stopped&mdash;so did I. Some change in his voice held
me! What was it? It was weak and husky, to be
sure; but there was something else, some force, some
thrill, some strange quality. Again the voice rose:
&#8220;Had I but served my God with half the zeal that I
have served&mdash;have served&mdash;,&#8221; almost unconsciously I
gave the words, &#8220;My King,&#8221; and he, without even
turning his face, took it up, saying &#8220;Aye, aye! &#8216;My
King&mdash;he would not in mine age have left me naked
to mine enemies!&#8217;&#8221; and he laughed. As I hurried
on, in all my nerves there was a creeping fear, for in
his voice I had felt the subtle difference between ranting
and <i>raving</i>&mdash;had felt the man was mad! And
that very morning an actor mentioned him, saying he
had seen him in liquor. &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;MacIlhenny never drinks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; insisted the actor, &#8220;when a man staggers in
his walk and talks to himself on the public street, it looks
as if he had been drinking too much rye.&#8221; And
another standing by, laughingly said: &#8220;Perhaps the old
chap has eaten too little, instead of drinking too much!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>Such cruel truths are sometimes said in jest. A
few days later, having only to appear in the farce,
I was quite late in going to the theatre, and as I neared
the cottage, I saw lamplight streaming from its window,
and heard Sandy reciting, as usual. But there was
some other noise. His words, too, came in gusts and
gasps, and I said to myself: &#8220;Why, that sounds
exactly like two men rehearsing a combat for Richard
or Macbeth!&#8221; The cottage was flush with the sidewalk
and, as I came opposite the window, I could not
help looking in, and there I stood and stared, for in the
center of the room old Sandy and his wife were struggling
desperately for the possession of a hatchet which
he held! &#8220;Sandy!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Sandy!&#8221; and all the
time Macbeth&#8217;s lines poured from his lips: &#8220;They have
tied me to a stake!&#8221; Almost he wrenched himself free
from her: &#8220;I cannot fly, and bear-like, I must fight
the course!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment his wife tore the hatchet from his
hand and flung it across the room. He plunged forward
to recover it, but in a twinkling she had a grip
upon his arms just above each elbow, and next moment
she had shoved him into the chair close to the window,
and leaning over him, in spite of his writhings, held him
tight.</p>

<p>She must have felt my gaze, for suddenly she turned
her white face and saw me. Into her eyes there came
both fear and furious anger, and then, without loosing
her hold for one moment on Sandy&#8217;s arms, she thrust<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
her face forward, and catching the shade between her
teeth, she fiercely dragged it down! And though the
rebuff was sharp as a blow in the face, yet for a moment
more I stood staring, and saw on the white shade a
black shadow-woman bending over and holding fast a
shadow-man, and, as a kaleidoscope responds to a touch,
at a single movement these shadows blurred, parted,
joined again, and this time, though she still held him
close, the shadow-woman was on her knees, and her
head was on the breast of the shadow-man!&mdash;and
ashamed to have watched so long, I hurried away
and said to myself: &#8220;To-morrow I will go there, and
sharp words shall not drive me away, until I learn by
what route help can reach them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day I stood and rapped and rapped, but no one
answered to my rapping. The house was very quiet,
the room seemed empty, but when I carefully looked
I saw a little smoke rising from the chimney. The
following day the shade was down&mdash;I saw no smoke&mdash;but
I was obstinate, and I went around to the back
door and knocked there, and was instantly met by a
white-faced &#8220;fury!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you have come to spy for them!
Well, take them the news! Their work is done! They
have no one now to fear&mdash;he&#8217;s gone! He that was
greater than them all! Come!&#8221; dragging me by main
force into the room and to the bed-room door: &#8220;See for
yourself how he lies there, dead of slow starvation!&#8221;
One forced glance I gave at the long, long, rigid outline<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
on the bed, but even that forced glance caught, mockingly
peeping from under the dead man&#8217;s pillow, a
yellow-covered play-book.</p>

<p>Wrenching myself away from the sight, I turned,
and putting my arms about her trembling, old body, I
held her close and said: &#8220;Oh, you poor wife! you
poor, poor wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood within my circling arms quite still for an
instant, then suddenly her hard face broke into convulsive
weeping. She thrust me from her, gasping:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t! I say!&#8221; and fled to him, while I rushed
from the house bearing my ill-news.</p>

<p>Everyone was shocked, and one was wounded, that
Sandy had not asked his help. He did not understand
the sturdy pride of the old pair who accepted
nothing they had not earned and asked of the world
but one thing, and that was a decent privacy to
suffer in.</p>

<p>Three of the actors went at once to the house, the
one who had felt hurt, a gentle and kindly soul, acting
as spokesman. They offered help to her and burial
for Sandy, but they were met with such invective and
imprecation as fairly stunned them, and though, by
their secret help, they later on saved poor MacIlhenny
from the Potter&#8217;s Field, they were compelled to beat a
retreat before his frenzied widow.</p>

<p>With bitter sarcasm she invited one to enter and
&#8220;bring a brush and see if he could find in that house one
crumb of bread!&#8221; She told them exactly &#8220;how many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
weeks a man could live upon a kit of tools pawned one
by one;&#8221; she reviled them as &#8220;thieves&#8221; for stealing
her husband&#8217;s &#8220;great thoughts and ideas of acting;&#8221;
jeered at them for &#8220;cowards,&#8221; that they had not
&#8220;dared to stab him,&#8221; though they had &#8220;dogged his steps
with evil intent many a dark night;&#8221; hailed them as
&#8220;hypocrites,&#8221; because they hid their joy and, pretending
grief, came here and offered &#8220;decent burial&#8221;&mdash;and as
they slowly withdrew, she stood upon her doorstep and
called after them: &#8220;Hypocrites! hypocrites! You
starved him to slow death&mdash;and he was broken-hearted!&#8221;</p>

<p>The word seemed to catch her own ear. She paused&mdash;slowly
she repeated, &#8220;broken-hearted!&#8221; Then suddenly
she caught the clue&mdash;flung her gaunt arms wide&mdash;she
lifted her tortured eyes to the sky, and with a
burst of bitter triumph, cried: &#8220;But a broken and contrite
heart, O God, shalt Thou not despise!&#8221;</p>

<p>And hearing that splendid declaration&mdash;that so
thrills with hope!&mdash;those who had all unintentionally
worked her woe, bowed their heads and breathed a
quick&mdash;Amen!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">John Hickey: Coachman</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;This is to certify that the bearer, John Hickey, five
years in my employ, is as honest a man as ever strode
a horse.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;(Signed), <span class="smcap">McDowell</span>, General.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The bearer, John Hickey, stood tall, straight and
uncovered before me, while I read the above recommendation.
There were several others, but I never
looked at them. I knew something of &#8220;McDowell,
General,&#8221; in California, and I was persuaded that a
man who served him for five years possessed something
more than &#8220;honesty&#8221; in the outfit of his virtues.</p>

<p>But he had, in my opinion, received a still better
recommendation at the very moment of his coming
into our lives, on that bright summer morning. I had
been sitting on the front porch with a dog on each side
of me&mdash;that being my usual allowance. Both these
dogs&mdash;Maida and Sancho&mdash;yearned with a great yearning
to exterminate the whole race of organ-grinders.
They also had a profound dislike for that rather large
body of men and women who move back and forth on
the earth&#8217;s surface carrying bundles. Therein lay their
only fault; otherwise, they were good, honest, self-respecting
dogs. And it must be admitted that this
peculiarity of theirs helped to keep things lively about
the place and our blood in quick circulation. Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
when John Hickey entered the gates, carrying an
unusually large valise, there was a roar and a rush
before I could form one word of command or entreaty.
The blazing eyes and white, uncovered fangs of the
dogs told so plainly of their fell intention of reducing
him and his valise to a condition resembling desiccated
codfish, that anyone might have been frightened. But
before they reached him I heard a calm voice, and an
unmistakable Irish one, saying: &#8220;Well, well! What
is it now? What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lightning could not have stopped them quicker.
Their heads lowered, their tails sagged down in a
shamed sort of a way. They stretched their heads out
and sniffed him a moment. Then, with a wild yelp of
joy, Sancho, with slavering jaws, bounded at his breast,
striking staggering blows by way of welcome, while
Maida, the fierce, was standing erect on hind legs at his
side, kissing his protesting hands, and digging with
both great paws in his side. At last they subsided a
little. He stood, showing the traces of their rapturous
welcome, while they sat at his feet, and looking into
his face, told him, with shining, loving eyes and
excited beating of their tails, that he was the very fellow
they had been searching forever since the seal of
their puppyhood&#8217;s blindness had fallen from their
foolish, blue eyes.</p>

<p>During the lull the man produced his little packet of
recommendations and passed them to me. My husband,
returning at that moment, engaged him in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
conversation consisting mainly of questions and
answers, and that gave me a chance to look at &#8220;the
bearer, John Hickey.&#8221; The only Irish thing about
him was his voice. He was tall, square of shoulder,
flat of back, clear-skinned and ruddy, with good features,
keen, light-blue eyes, and brown hair, which he
wore in an odd way, parted down the back of his head,
and brushed forward and upward toward his ears,
which gave him a peculiarly cocky and alert air. There
was something in the carriage of his head, the turning
out of his feet, the hang of his arms and the position
of his hands, when he stood at &#8220;attention,&#8221; that
said, as plain as words could say, &#8220;Soldier, yes; &#8216;ex,&#8217;
if you like, but soldier all the same.&#8221; I thought that
then; I knew it by night.</p>

<p>I was just going to put a question to him when the
sunlight played him a trick and betrayed his poor, little
secret to me. In vain, then, the upright pose, the
cocky air, and jaunty manner! It must have been
some hours since he had shaved&mdash;he wore no hair upon
his face, and as he stood there the sun shone full upon
him, revealing on cheek, and chin, and upper lip, the
glittering frost of age, and he stood revealed, an old
man.</p>

<p>I felt touched by the bold bluff he was making
against Time, and I wished to give him a trial. Therefore,
I looked steadily at my lord and master, and,
using that great, unwritten language understood and
used by every husband and wife on the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
earth, I signified my desire for him to engage John
Hickey, and he, being a man of intelligence and a
husband in good standing, replied by the same means:
&#8220;All right! but I&#8217;m afraid he is a bit elderly. Still,
if you wish it!&#8221; And he told John to come with him
and he would show him his quarters and settle about
wages, etc. The words were scarcely out of his lips
before the dogs were up and leading the way, with
waving tails and many backward turnings of their
heads. I think I have said the day was very hot, and
as the two men stepped from the lawn to the carriage-drive,
my husband, finding his hat oppressive, removed
it and held it in his hand. Thus it happened that he
walked with bared head at John Hickey&#8217;s side, while
he escorted him to his new home. It was a trivial
thing to notice, yet there came a time when it was
sharply recalled to me.</p>

<p>The new man had not to take the horses out that
first day at all, and in about an hour after his installment
he sent a messenger to me, asking if I had a
large flag, and if I had one would I not send it down
to him, the coachman, who promised to take good care
of it?</p>

<p>We had a large flag&mdash;yes. But what on earth did
the man want with it then? There were four good,
solid weeks between us and the glorious Fourth of
July. What could he mean? Ah, well! let him have
it. So the flag, a really fine one, as it happened, to
his great joy was sent down to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>Shortly after that I saw him with a lot of rope and
some tools, tinkering, under the active supervision of
both dogs, at the old flagstaff standing on the hill
which rises sharply at the back of the stable. Later
in the afternoon, chancing to glance from the window,
there, sure enough, was the brave, old flag, floating free
from the top of the staff. And very pretty it looked,
too, against the blue sky and above the fresh, green
foliage of the young summer-time. Ah, I thought,
that&#8217;s it, is it? But I had not got it all, even yet, for
just before dinner I heard an explosion of some sort
of firearm! My heart gave a jump, and I exclaimed:
&#8220;Good mercy! Has the poor man met with an accident?&#8221;</p>

<p>I ran to the window. Out on the hill, by the flagstaff,
stood John, while through a cloud of smoke the
flag came fluttering down just as the red sun sank from
view. I understood at last! My soldier-coachman was
saluting the flag, and firing for a sunset gun a rusty old
blunderbuss that was likely to kick him through the
greenhouse every time he touched it.</p>

<p>I confess I sat down and laughed hysterically. He
had intended to greet the rising sun in the same manner,
but as sickness in the family required quiet at that
hour, he contented himself with simply running up his
flag at exactly the proper moment. And when my husband,
either from secret sympathy with &#8220;Old John&#8217;s&#8221;
feelings, or from a fear for the safety of the greenhouse,
gave him a good musket and enough ammunition for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
modest sort of battle, John Hickey, coachman, was
proud and happy.</p>

<p>And so he entered upon his life with us. We spoke
of hiring? In our dull way we for some time believed
that we had engaged or accepted him, not at all understanding,
till much later, that he had accepted us, and
that the house was his, the place was his, the fruits
thereof, and that the family were his&mdash;his household
gods&mdash;whom he loved devotedly, and served faithfully
all the rest of his life.</p>

<p>We were quick to discover that in &#8220;Old John&#8221; we
had an excellent servant and an eccentric man, while
the slow years piled up proof upon proof of his loyalty.
He won my heart at once by quickly learning the
individual characters of our horses. One in particular,
my favorite saddle-horse, I was a bit anxious about,
since he was getting the reputation of being ugly. He
(Creole by name) was a big, spirited Kentucky horse,
with an exquisitely tender mouth, requiring a very light
as well as steady hand. Two or three great fellows,
with sledge-hammer fists, had tried to ride him on his
bridle, instead of on his back, and he had, as the result,
lifted them not too gently over the top of his handsome
head, and they raised the cry of ugliness, when he had
simply acted in self-defense, as would any other Kentucky
gentleman.</p>

<p>But when &#8220;Old John&#8221; returned from exercising Creole
for the first time, he remarked: &#8220;Ah, he&#8217;s a fine
fellow; he&#8217;s got a mouth as tender as a baby&#8217;s, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
heart as bold as a lion&#8217;s. I will be glad to see you on
him, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>John loved the horses as much as people love their
children. When he came to us the horses were most
all in their prime, but as the years crept by they aged
and weakened together, and I was always amused, albeit
touched as well, to see &#8220;Old John&#8217;s&#8221; fervent efforts to
prove to the world that they still preserved all the
nerve, vitality and fire of youth. And when the time
came when the carriage-horses ought really to have been
replaced, &#8220;Old John&#8221; was a sorrowful man and an
anxious one; and at our faintest suggestion of a change,
with frowning brow and trembling lips, the old man
would march stiffly off to the stable, where he would
assure its occupants that &#8220;they were mighty fine horses,
and people ought to know it by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like most people of affectionate disposition, he was
very fond of keeping anniversaries. All high-days,
holidays, and birthdays were precious boons to him, but
they came to be occasions of more or less anxiety to the
family, owing to his utter inability to express his joy
without the help of an explosion. It would seem that
the comparatively harmless running up of flags, backed
by explosions of varying degrees of heaviness, would be
a sufficient outlet for any man&#8217;s joy. But John Hickey
had still a &#8220;card up his sleeve,&#8221; so to speak, for the
climax of his love and enthusiasm, the actual perfect
flowering of his joy could only be attained by the
aid of blazing tar. A great bonfire of wood was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
to be despised, but tar was the material worthy of his
attention, and when he had diligently sought for and
found the most dangerous possible places, and had put
in each a kettle of flaming tar, and could gallop wildly
back and forth from one kettle to another, trying to
prevent a general conflagration, he was the most perfectly
happy man I ever saw.</p>

<p>Not more than ten minutes after his discovery that
my birthday fell on Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day he was at the
house, asking if the ladies wouldn&#8217;t let him have some
&#8220;grane material.&#8221; That seemed a very vague order&mdash;&#8220;grane
material&#8221;&mdash;leaving such a wide margin for
speculation as to what kind of &#8220;grane material&#8221; he
meant. But the only information he would give was
that he just wanted &#8220;grane material, dress goods or the
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon my mother gave him a deep flounce of all
green silk, taken from a retired stage-dress of mine.
This he ripped, and pressed, and sewed at, till, lo! on
Saint Patrick&#8217;s morning there fluttered from the flagstaff
a brilliant, green silk flag, and I was informed it
was there in my honor, not Saint Patrick&#8217;s. In the
years that followed I was very rarely at home on my
birthday, but no matter how far away I might be, early
on Saint Patrick&#8217;s morning the green silk flag ran
swiftly up the staff. &#8220;But mark this now,&#8221; as he himself
would say, never even in my honor, never once did
that green flag fly above the &#8220;Stars and Stripes.&#8221;
Honest, old Irish-American that he was, the flag he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
served with arms in his hands was the first flag in the
world for him, and had to take the place of honor every
time.</p>

<p>So thoroughly did he identify himself with the family
that when anything particular was going on, he, without
invitation, yet equally without the faintest idea of
presuming, always took his share. On one occasion
&#8220;Old John&#8221; learned that I was expecting a visit from
my husband&#8217;s mother, and hearing me speak of the
freshness of her looks, the brightness of her mind, and
her extreme activity as something remarkable in one of
her advanced years, his interest was at once aroused.
Knowing his ways as well as I did know them at that
time, I suppose I should have bridled his fine, Irish
enthusiasm; but, truth to tell, I was so busy with my
own joyous preparations for her welcome coming that
I gave no thought to the possible doings of my eccentric
coachman. Mamma H&mdash;&mdash; had heard much of him,
and was amused by his stately salute to her from the
box. As we entered the gate we met welcome No. 1,
in the form of a great flag flying from a staff in front
of the house, a thing which had never happened before,
and never happened after that visit. Then &#8220;Old John&#8221;
drove down to the stable, while we ascended the stairs,
to be met at the top, where we had the least breath to
bear it, with welcome No. 2, in the shape of an explosion
so heavy that it shook the color out of the cheeks
and the breath out of the body of the welcomed lady.
Seeing her, after two or three desperate gasps, recover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
the breath which had been literally shaken out of her,
we looked at one another, and all exclaimed together:
&#8220;John Hickey!&#8221; Then she understood, and falling into
a chair, she spread out her hands on its arms, laid her
head back, and laughed&mdash;laughed till the tears came.
When she could speak again, she remarked: &#8220;What
a nice, kind old man, to take so much trouble on my
account&mdash;but he is a bit noisy, isn&#8217;t he, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>In his preparations for this visit &#8220;Old John&#8221; not
only shaved himself so closely that he must have
removed several layers of cuticle along with his beard,
but I had a suspicion that he had shaved the cobblestones
about the stables as well, so shining clean they
were, and so hopeless was it to search for a blade of
grass between them. Everything was in precise order
down there, and I guessed at once that he wished, himself,
to show our guest about his domain. At that time
he had received an injury&mdash;was very lame, and secretly
suffered greatly. I say secretly, yet we knew all about
it, but it was such a shame and mortification to him to
have his condition noticed or spoken of that we all mercifully
pretended ignorance at that period of his troubles.
When, therefore, we went forth for a morning stroll,
and were showing Mamma H&mdash;&mdash; about the place, I
was not surprised to see him hovering about, watching
for a chance to capture the guest, and the way he did
it was very neat. There was a tiny gutter down there;
it must have been fully six inches broad, and as we
approached, &#8220;Old John,&#8221; tall and straight (what suffering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
that forced straightness cost him Heaven only
knows), stepped quickly forward, and with impressive
politeness helped the lady across&mdash;the gutter being perfectly
dry at the time. But observe, this action placed
him instantly in the position of escort and guide. We
all recognized the fact, and took up second fiddles and
played to &#8220;Old John&#8217;s&#8221; first.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am sentimental, but to me it was rather
touching to see how quickly these two old people recognized
each other&mdash;one a lady born, the other brought
up to servitude, but each touched with the fine mystery
of old age. With all her gentle dignity, he knew she
took a real interest in him, and he gave her a passionate
gratitude for her evident comprehension of the pains
and penalties time exacted of him. On her part, she
saw at a glance the honesty, the courage of the man,
and his great, kind heart, and knew him to be as innocent
as a little child of intentional presumption&mdash;knew
that his forwardness was the result of his loving desire
to do something to give pleasure to the family. And
so it came to pass that they paced about here, there, and
yonder&mdash;he showing her the horses, the framed pedigrees
of my little dogs, two or three wonderful lithographs
of myself (all framed at his own expense), and
finally presented her with a receipt for a certain liniment
for a shoulder-strain in horses, and, having completed
the round, he brought her back to us with great
pride and dignity.</p>

<p>I never knew a man who loved flowers with such tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
as did this queer, old coachman. His garden,
principally laid out in lard-pails, tomato-cans, and an
occasional soap-box, filled my heart with envy by its
astounding mass of beautiful bloom. Even the gardeners
used to grunt unwilling admission of his wonderful
luck. &#8217;Twas all fish that came to John&#8217;s net. Sunflowers
or daisies, lilies or morning-glories, pinks or
japonicas&mdash;everything he could beg, buy or pick up&mdash;he
so craved, so longed for flowers. As a chicken will
rush for a crust of bread, so would &#8220;Old John&#8221; rush
when sick or dying plants were cast from the greenhouse.
He always gathered them up and carried them
out of sight, to make his examinations in private and
decide upon the course of treatment necessary. A bit
later he could be seen, happy and perspiring, filling yet
another lard-pail with leaf-mould, etc., a big dog on
each side watching with restless, inquiring eyes each
movement, and sniffing with infinite curiosity at every
article used, while John worked on and conversed
affably with them all the time about the nature of the
plant and his hopes for its future. One of his great
successes was the wonderful restoration to life and
opulent beauty of a pair of castaway begonias, almost
leafless, entirely yellow, and sick unto death. They
were thrown out bodily, and when &#8220;Old John&#8221; picked
them up he was greeted with a roar of laughter from
the gardener. The old man was nettled, but he only
remarked: &#8220;Suppose ye wait a bit now, and by-and-by
I&#8217;ll be laughin&#8217; with ye&mdash;perhaps.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>A long time after, as he helped me dismount one
day, he asked me &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t I go down to his room a
minute, he wanted to show me something.&#8221;</p>

<p>And there, in riotous health and beauty, stood two
rarely fine begonias, presenting a mass of foliage and a
prodigality of bloom only to be found in &#8220;Old John&#8217;s&#8221;
garden. I was frankly envious, to his great pride.
One plant was loaded with great, coral-like clusters.
The other dripped clear, white, waxen blossoms from
trembling pink stems, and wore such an air of united
purity and abundance, that, almost without thought, I
exclaimed: &#8220;That flower should be dedicated to the
Virgin Mary!&#8221; John gave me a startled glance, and
said, &#8220;Why-y-y, why, madam! you&#8217;re a Protestant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;and because I am a Protestant
am I to be denied the privilege of loving and honoring
the immaculate mother of our Lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, I had long known that there was something
wrong between my poor, old chap and his Church&mdash;the
servants declaring that he was no Catholic, or even
that he was an unbeliever. &#8220;Old John Hickey?&#8221;
Why, Catholicism was born in him! It was in the blood
of his veins, in the marrow of his bones. No matter
how harshly he might speak of his Church, nor how
long he might neglect his duties, almost unknown to
himself, down in the bottom of his heart the old faith
lived, warm and strong, and it only needed an emergency
to make him turn to the Mother Church as trustingly
as a babe would turn to its mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>I found that &#8220;Old John,&#8221; in his fancied quarrel with
the Church, had suffered cruelly. He had neglected
his duties, and had then been unhappy because of that
neglect. He was very bitter and deeply wounded, and
that day he exclaimed sadly: &#8220;It&#8217;s hard, madam&mdash;it&#8217;s
hard that a man should be made to lose his soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never say that again, John!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;There is
just one man created who can lose your soul for you,
and that man is John Hickey.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me a moment, then putting one forefinger
on my arm he asked, solemnly: &#8220;Madam Clara,
are you talking as a Catholic or as a Protestant, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Laugh I had to, though I saw it hurt the poor,
bewildered one before me and belied the tears in my
own eyes. But I made answer quickly: &#8220;I&#8217;m speaking
neither as Catholic nor Protestant, but simply as a
woman, who, like yourself, has a soul, and does not
want to lose it! Don&#8217;t look so unhappy! Your
Church is beautiful, great and powerful, but there is
One who is greater, more beautiful and more powerful.
In all the ages there has been but One who left the
unspeakable joy of Heaven to come to earth to suffer
and toil, to love and lose, to hope and despair, and
finally to give up His perfect life to an ignominious
death, because His boundless love saw no other way to
save us from the horror of eternal death! He paid
too great a price for souls to cast them easily away.
There is but one Saviour for us all, be we what we may!
There is but one God whose smile makes Heaven. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
travel by different paths&mdash;oh, yes! We wear different
liveries, some showing the gorgeous vestments of the
stately Catholic, some the solemn drab of the Quaker,
others black robes. But the paths all lead to the one
place, and the great questions are, do we love the One
we seek, and have we loved and helped those we traveled
with? John, make Christ your Church, and the
mightiest cannot harm you!&#8221; and, catching up the
scant fold of my riding-habit, I turned and fled from
the only sermon I ever preached in my life, while from
behind me came certain familiar sentences, such as, &#8220;Yis,
yis! Ye&#8217;re fine horses, that ye are, but it&#8217;s too soon for
water yit, y&#8217;r know, because,&#8221; etc., etc., but all spoken
in so husky a voice it might have been a stranger&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Anxious, economical old body, from the early fall
he began to watch over the welfare of our house. We,
sleeping in it, knew no sooner of a loosened shutter
than did &#8220;Old John,&#8221; who immediately began a still-hunt
for the offender. But his drollest habit, I think, was
the making of a slow, close search over all the grounds,
and even out into the road, after every storm, seeking
for possible slates torn from the roof. On one of my
homecomings from a long season he met me with a
small bill for mending the roof, and he anxiously
explained that he did it, he knew, without orders, but
if he hadn&#8217;t, it would have got worse and made a leak
and would have ruined thousands of dollars&#8217; worth of
beautiful frocks up there! Please bear in mind that
the figures mentioned are &#8220;Old John&#8217;s,&#8221; not mine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>I assured him it was all right. I thought his face
would clear, but no, not yet. He carefully produced
a large, flat package from under his table, and when the
package was gravely opened, there lay a collection of
broken slates. John had saved them all as his witnesses,
and he would take up the best of them and
explain: &#8220;If it had broken this way, instead of that
way, it might have been replaced, but as it was, do you
think now, ma&#8217;am, that I could have done any different?&#8221;
The second assurance satisfied him, and his
face resumed its usual contented look.</p>

<p>So we all moved our wonted ways until that lovely
spring day, when a pale-faced messenger ran up to the
house to say, &#8220;Oh, madam! Old John has had a fall,
and he&#8217;s hurt bad!&#8221;</p>

<p>I thrust my feet into a pair of bed-room slippers,
being myself ill at the time, flung a loose gown about
me, and, with my mother, hurried with all possible
speed down to the stable. He was stretched out&mdash;not
sitting&mdash;in a horribly unnatural position on a chair.
His face was ghastly, his eyes dim, his pulse almost
unfindable. I gave him a stimulant, praying inwardly
that I might not be doing wrong. I learned from the
others that he had washed the pony phaeton, and was
pushing it backward to its place when he had slipped
and fallen heavily, face forward, on those cruel cobblestones.</p>

<p>I was convinced he was seriously injured, and leaving
my mother attending to his wants and directing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
the men how to get him to his room, I hurried back to
the house, wishing at every step that my husband would
come, and hastily telephoned for the doctor. When
the doctor and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; were both on the spot and
I could retire to the background, I was surprised at
my feeling of profound depression. &#8220;Old John&#8221; had
had two falls far and away worse than this one, but
that look on his face, it was neither age nor pain&mdash;though
both were there&mdash;that so impressed me. It
was a look of hopeless finality, and accepting it as a
warning, I hastened to inquire if John would see a
priest, and lo! as I had thought, the old faith was
warm within him, since he answered readily that he&#8217;d
see the priest, if we would be so kind.</p>

<p>But here the doctor interfered, saying he should prefer
the patient to be kept quiet, and to my eager protest
made answer: &#8220;He is really safe for the night;
the morning will tell whether he is fatally injured or
not, and I promise I will give you ample notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so I opened my ears to reason, and shut
them hard and close against that still, small voice
that cried, &#8220;Send! send!&#8221; and kept repeating the
two words I had seen written upon that stricken,
old face: &#8220;The end! the end!&#8221; In a conflict between
reason and instinct I have always found instinct to be
right, but, alas! I yielded to reason that time.</p>

<p>Down in &#8220;Old John&#8217;s&#8221; room all had been arranged
for the night. The gardener was to sit up for the
next three hours, then my husband would come down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
and watch the rest of the night. To the patient this
was an arrangement of such outrageous impropriety and
so exciting that it had seemingly to be abandoned. The
lamp was shaded carefully, an open watch lay on the
table by the medicine-bottle, glass and spoon, and all
were neighbored by a pitcher of lemonade.</p>

<p>Lying on the floor at the foot of the bed was the
great dog John had reared from puppyhood, and in the
corner, in the seat of the old rocking-chair, three calmly-confident
cats lay sleeping. It was all so quiet that
when the sick man spoke even his weak tones could be
heard plainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, will you be thanking the ladies for
their goodness to me, and if you please, sir, could me
room be made proper-like before either of them might
be looking in to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>The promise was given. Then, after a moment, he said:
&#8220;If you please, sir, would yer be asking the man to keep
the door ajar a bit through the night, that the dog might
have his freedom? Yer see he&#8217;s used to it, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>This promise also was given, and John lay quiet for
some minutes. Suddenly his face became troubled,
and once more he opened his weary eyes, and looking
up at his long-time employer, he anxiously asked: &#8220;Sir,
has anyone had the sense to bring down the flag?&#8221;</p>

<p>And said employer, knowing nothing whatever about
it, but anxious only to quiet the patient&#8217;s mind,
answered, &#8220;Yes, the flag is down,&#8221; though at that
moment it was hanging limp at the staff.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>&#8220;John, would you like a drink of water?&#8221; asked
my husband, finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you&#8217;ll be so kind, sir.&#8221; (Pause.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish for anything else, John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For nothing in the world, sir.&#8221; (Another pause.)</p>

<p>Then after a faint movement or two: &#8220;Sir, perhaps
you&#8217;ll be kind enough to help me raise my right
hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>The heavy, nearly helpless hand was raised and laid
gently across his breast. He gave a sigh of seeming
contentment and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all, John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, then, John!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir!&#8221; he tenderly replied.</p>

<p>And my husband turned and walked quietly out of
the room, to make his report to me, who, anxious and
foreboding, was awaiting him. At the lifting of &#8220;Old
John&#8217;s&#8221; hand I burst into tears. Ah! I thought, he
needed no man&#8217;s help to lift that brawny right hand of
his when he swore allegiance to the Constitution of the
United States, or later when he took the solemn oath
that made him a soldier under that beloved flag,
beneath whose folds he now lay, old and broken! And
even as the thought passed through my mind, a handful
of pebbles came dashing against the window. We both
sprang forward, and looking down we saw the terrified
face of the gardener, gleaming white in the moonlight!</p>

<p>In his fright he babbled Scandinavian to us, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
finally dragged from his unwilling throat one English
word, &#8220;Come! come!&#8221;</p>

<p>My husband rushed with him down to the sick-room,
and at the moment of their entrance found everything
so precisely as he had left it that he felt angry at the
man&#8217;s stupid fright. But before he could speak, three
shadowy, gray forms slipped from the room, and the
dog rose slowly, giving him a sullen, threatening look,
then turned, and resting his heavy jaws on the foot of
the bed, he lifted his great voice in one long, dismal
howl, and dropped to his place again upon the floor,
where he lay half growling, half groaning. Fearing
that such a noise would disturb the sick man, my husband
hurried to the bedside, and, laying his hand upon
&#8220;Old John&#8217;s&#8221; head, he stood dumfounded, for from
the body he touched life had flown!</p>

<p>It seemed incredible, for he had never moved. His
hand lay on his breast just as it had been placed there.
His face wore the same look of contentment that had come
to it when he had said he wished &#8220;for nothing in the
world, sir,&#8221; and later, when he had added, &#8220;Good-night,
sir!&#8221; having, at the same time, bidden &#8220;good-night&#8221;
to life and the world.</p>

<p>So, surrounded by the tender care of the family he
adored&mdash;in his bed&mdash;under the same roof that sheltered
the horses he had loved&mdash;beneath the great flag he
reverenced&mdash;with his dog at his feet&mdash;quiet, peaceful,
dignified, such was the passing of John Hickey, coachman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>We covered him with flowers. Nothing was too
good to be offered in this last gift to the man who had
walked so far with us along life&#8217;s highway. I had
already ordered mass to be said for him. And then I
paid him my last visit. I went alone, and talked to
him, as foolish women will talk to their dead, and told
him how and why I missed sending for the priest, and
while I looked at him, I noticed for the first time what
a fine head he had, the clearness of his profile, and
above all, the calm dignity of his expression. Slowly,
like music, there rolled through my memory certain
words of Holy Writ: &#8220;He raiseth up the poor out of
the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
that He may set him with princes, even with the princes
of his people.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I knelt at the coffin&#8217;s side and prayed for this
good and faithful servant and friend. A little later I
stood on the porch, and through blinding tears saw my
husband a second time walk with bared head by &#8220;Old
John&#8217;s&#8221; side&mdash;a second time escorting him to a
home.</p>

<p>So he passed out of my life, but never will he pass
from my memory. Though he left us without &#8220;warning,&#8221;
and asked for no &#8220;recommendation,&#8221; we cannot
complain, since he &#8220;bettered&#8221; himself in following the
summons of the Great Master.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Black Watch</h2>
</div>


<p>That old, black &#8220;Watch&#8221; believed himself the general
superintendent of John Tyler&#8217;s &#8220;back-wood&#8221;
farm, as well as the guardian of his family, no one
could doubt who noticed his busy self-importance,
from the candle-light breakfast till the eight o&#8217;clock
retirement of the family. Then, only, he felt free to
visit the secret repository of the few bones he had
acquired, or to take a run down the road, and through
the woods, to pick a fight with the only dog of his
weight to be found within a ten-mile radius.</p>

<p>I should not like to say, off-hand, just what breed
&#8220;Watch&#8221; represented, but he was black all over&mdash;was
short-haired, heavy-built, and mastiff-like in head and
chest. One ear had been injured in a fight with city
dogs, and it lopped helplessly ever after, while the good
ear seemed doubly quick and perky by comparison.</p>

<p>Now, it was this faithful creature&#8217;s clear, brown eyes
that were first to discover something wrong about young
Mrs. Tyler. I don&#8217;t suppose he knew she had worked
to the breaking point&mdash;that five babies, with barely a
year separating one birth-day from another, were enough
to break the high ambition with which she had begun
her life, here in the woods, helping in rough, out-door
work, as well as trying to make a comfortable home for
her husband. And now, that another little one was
expected, her songs had ceased, and often, she would, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
the midst of her work, stop and stand, with eyes fixed
on vacancy, a heavy frown on her face that had always
before been so bright and kindly in expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch,&#8221; alone, noticed this. The children were
too little, and John Tyler too busy, and the brown eyes
would study the clouded face until he could bear his
trouble in silence no longer, and he would whimper,
and push his cold, damp nose into her hand, but instead
of the pat he expected, he several times received a sharp
rebuke that made him lower head and tail and retire
fully five feet from her, where he sat and rapped out a
faint, deprecating &#8220;tattoo&#8221; on the bare floor with his
tail.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would rush out and find his master,
and climb up and put his paws on his breast and whine,
and look back at the house, and John would say:
&#8220;What the deuce is the matter, &#8216;Watch&#8217;? I don&#8217;t know
what you want!&#8221; and the man that &#8220;helped&#8221; would
say: &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s got something tree&#8217;d, I s&#8217;pose, and
wants you to go help him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the baby arrived, and John Tyler began to
understand that an awful thing had happened. His
wife&#8217;s mind was certainly clouded&mdash;she was, in country
parlance, &#8220;not right,&#8221; and worst of all she had a mortal
hatred for the poor, little new-comer. She could hardly
force herself to give it the commonest care, and many a
time its wails reached the father beyond the house, and
only when he entered would the mother sullenly take
the child and care for it. &#8220;Watch,&#8221; though he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
the most active of farm dogs, took in the situation at
once, and calmly assumed the position of nurse to the
detested baby.</p>

<p>Never before had he been known to get on the bed,
but now he jumped on it every day and curled himself
up beside the little unfortunate, and many a time when
she cried he would stand over her and gravely lick her
tiny face until she stopped, to stare at him in wonder.</p>

<p>He did not wholly neglect his other duties. He saw
to the proper watering of the stock, night and morning,
taking a few laps of the water himself, as if he were
testing it. He led the horses to the field to plow, or
to the woods &#8220;to haul,&#8221; as the case might be, running
anxiously ahead to see that the road was clear, and then
ambling back to bark at their heels a few times before
making a circle about the wagon and trotting underneath
it a few minutes, to make quite sure the running
gear was all right.</p>

<p>Neither did the two eldest of the children succeed in
getting to the small creek flowing at the back of the
house, without his companionship, though he knew
well he would be sent into the water by them for about
a peck of chips, after which they were absolutely certain
to try to ride him home. Still, it had been his
habit to watch the road closely for any traveling dog,
at sight of whom he would rush forth with waving tail,
and after due investigation of his quality, would either
challenge him to mortal combat, or invite him inside
the gate to converse about the state of the roads and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the scarcity of rabbits, etc. But when the family
trouble began, he gave such pleasures up and turned
all his attention to his people.</p>

<p>So the day came when John Tyler was compelled to
go to town, a great city now, but then a struggling,
little town on the edge of a marsh. He dared not
leave his wife alone with the children, so, with great
difficulty, he secured the help of a young girl, for a
couple of days, and then with a big load to take and a
long list of things to bring back for the winter&#8217;s comfort,
he started, and was greatly surprised when old,
black &#8220;Watch,&#8221; who always enjoyed his &#8220;city&#8221; trip
so thoroughly, after escorting him with leaps and barks
and short rushes at nothing in particular for a half
mile, suddenly sat down by the roadside and staid there,
regardless of his master&#8217;s inviting whistle.</p>

<p>Back at the house, the morning work was no sooner
done than the &#8220;girl&#8221; was astonished to see Mrs. Tyler
come from her room, dressed in her Sunday gown&mdash;a
work-basket hanging from her arm&mdash;and carrying the
hated baby. She briefly announced that she was going
to visit her neighbor. The &#8220;girl&#8221; told her she was
not strong enough for such a tramp, but she muttered
something about &#8220;a shorter way,&#8221; which frightened
the girl into reminding her how many wild animals
were still seen in the woods, and Mrs. Tyler had turned
such a white, angry face upon her, she had not dared
to speak again, but, looking after her, saw her twice
drive old &#8220;Watch&#8221; back, when he tried to follow her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>About one o&#8217;clock the Brockway family were surprised
to see young Mrs. Tyler at their door, and were
amazed when they found the baby was not with her!
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she lightly replied, &#8220;the girl was at home, she
would look after all the children.&#8221; In those days,
unless the mother died, all babes were reared by the
simple rule devised by Mother Nature&mdash;hence the
pained surprise of these kindly womenfolk at the all-day
abandonment of so young a child.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, Mrs. Tyler grew more and more
absent-minded, and finally her work fell to her lap, and
she sat in perfect silence. Suddenly she clasped her
head in her hands, she looked wildly from one face to
another, then down to her lap, when, with a shriek, she
sprang to her feet, and rushing into the next room
began throwing on her wraps, all the time moaning:
&#8220;Oh, my God! Oh, my God! help me&mdash;help me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She paid no attention whatever to remonstrances or
questions! They begged her to wait&mdash;they would harness
up and take her home! She seemed not to hear
them&mdash;only shivered and moaned: &#8220;Oh, God help me!&#8221;
and tore away from them, and out of the house, and
one who followed a little saw her break into a run
as soon as she was out of sight of the windows.</p>

<p>The women were greatly frightened, and calling one
of the men from work, sent him after her. He took
down a gun and easily and hastily followed the tracks
her feet had left in the soft earth on that damp November
day. Presently he came upon her work-basket,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
abandoned at the point where, by climbing the fence,
she could leave the regular road and make a cross-cut
through a strip of dense woodland. He frowned blackly
as he picked it up, saying to himself: &#8220;She must be
clean crazy to go through there alone! Why on earth
didn&#8217;t she bring old, black &#8216;Watch&#8217; with her? He
could bluff four times his weight in wild-cat, fox,
snake, or even in bear-skin! But alone and sick!
Good Lord!&#8221; and so grumbling to himself, but with
eye, ear and hand alert, he followed the woman, who
still kept ahead of him, until, as he was approaching a
sudden glen-like opening in the woods, he was startled
by a piercing scream, followed by the agonized cry of:
&#8220;Oh, my God! help me! help me!&#8221; and plunging forward,
he came upon Mrs. Tyler, who, in hastily trying
to clamber over a fallen tree, had been caught and was
held firmly by her clothing, and though she fought
madly to free herself, he noticed she never took her
eyes, for one instant, from some object beyond him.</p>

<p>Following the direction of her glance&mdash;he stood
stupefied. Almost in the center of an opening stood
one noble, hickory tree, and on the damp earth at its
foot lay a small, white bundle from which there came,
now and then, faint, hoarse wails of utter exhaustion,
while, with sturdy legs planted stiffly astride of the
abandoned baby, stood old, black &#8220;Watch&#8221;&mdash;a dog on
guard!</p>

<p>From the base of his skull to the root of his tail
every separate hair bristled fiercely up. His forehead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
wrinkled wickedly! His eyes glowed with a hot, red
fire, while he drew his lips back savagely, laying bare
every tooth he owned in the world.</p>

<p>Just as young Brockway was about to speak,
&#8220;Watch&#8221; half-wheeled about and gave tongue, for the
first time, in one snarling, half-strangled bark, and, following
the movement of the dog with his eyes, the
young fellow, for the first time, realized the true horror
of the situation, when in the dense undergrowth opposite
he saw a lumbering shape&mdash;caught a glimpse of
pig-like eyes&mdash;a flash of white, sharp tushes, and heard
a faint grunt from the brownish-black mass, as its
clumsy half-trot carried it into the depths of the
forest.</p>

<p>There was one shot sent wild by a trembling hand,
and, almost in the same moment, a loud, long r&mdash;r&mdash;rip,
r&mdash;r&mdash;rip, r&mdash;r&mdash;ripping of clothing and stitches
was heard, and a woman&#8217;s slender figure went flying
across the opening, and Mrs. Tyler flung herself upon
her knees, crying: &#8220;Give her to me, &#8216;Watch&#8217;! Oh, give
her to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet, before her hand could touch the child, the dog
turned upon her savagely, while she, seemingly beyond
all personal fear, threw her arms about his rigid neck,
pressing her agonized, white face against his black
head and fiercely opened, slavering jaws, while she
pleaded humbly: &#8220;Forgive me, &#8216;Watch&#8217;! I know I do
not deserve it&mdash;and you know just what I meant should
happen! But, forgive me, &#8216;Watch,&#8217; for her sake! Give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
her to me, honest, brave, old &#8216;Watch&#8217;! I promise you
I will love her all my life long!&#8221;</p>

<p>He held himself very stiff within her circling arms
for a moment, looking hard into her eyes, then suddenly
he brightened visibly&mdash;gave her one all-comprehensive
caress reaching from chin to brow&mdash;and gently, cautiously
stepping backward, left the piteous bundle
within the reach of her hungry hands. &#8216;Watch&#8217; first
looked across at Brockway and wagged a courteous
greeting to him, then he stretched himself, both fore
and aft, and yawned great, loud, throat-revealing yawns
that went far to show how long a time his muscles and
his nerves had been kept taut and on the strain.</p>

<p>Meantime, the first loving kiss, the first sweet
mother-kiss that blesses where it rests, had been given,
and under cover of the all-concealing, matronly shawl
of that period, the baby had established communication
with the quick-lunch-counter Dame Nature superintended.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler needed young Brockway&#8217;s help in getting
home, after the shock she had received, and at the
beginning of their long walk his horror of her was
so evident that, in self defence, she told him part of
her story, and with such effect that there were tears
in the lad&#8217;s eyes when he tried to realize what those
dreadful months must have been&mdash;during which she
could not recall ever to have seen the sun&mdash;could not
remember any act of her own doing, all that time&mdash;save
that one awful act!&mdash;was only conscious of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
desire&mdash;to destroy this child, because its coming would
prevent her husband from making the regular payment
on the farm, and he might lose it and be ruined&mdash;so
she watched and waited for a chance to abandon the
baby to the wild animals&mdash;that she might thus save
the farm and family&mdash;and he rejoiced with her, as she
told of how, suddenly at his home, she had had a loud,
rushing sound in her ears, the sunlight had become
visible to her, she had looked at her lap for her baby,
and then remembered she had left it in the woods to
be devoured! How she had run&mdash;how she had prayed,
and God had been merciful!&mdash;and he, Brockway, would
not hate and fear her now&mdash;would he? and he would
not speak of this any more than he could help?&mdash;and
oh, was not black &#8220;Watch&#8221; a hero to save her darling&#8217;s
life? But the boy thought she owed a good deal to the
condition of the bear. It was fat and sleek&mdash;well fed,
and therefore good-natured. Had it been rough-coated,
thin, hungry, &#8220;Watch&#8221; would have probably given his
life&mdash;and in vain! And then, at her gasping cry at
such a suggestion, he had, with rustic, bashful awkwardness,
&#8220;reckon&#8217;d he was a plumb fool at talkin&#8217;, and
would she please just not count that in at all?&#8221; and so
had left her safely at her kitchen-door, while &#8220;Watch,&#8221;
dropping the work-basket he had carried home, escorted
the young man a short distance down the road, then,
taking a jaunty farewell of him, gave himself up to a
careful and thorough smelling of apparently the entire
farm and all its implements. Of course it was troublesome,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
but it was the only trustworthy way of finding
exactly what had been done during his absence and
that of his master.</p>

<p>Late that night, John Tyler, tired, chilled and
anxious, drove home, and was met some distance down
the road by old, black &#8220;Watch,&#8221; carrying a lighted
lantern, and prancing and plunging about so joyously
that the lantern light seemed like some small animal
running along the road, gliding under bushes, even
darting up tree trunks occasionally in its efforts to escape
the pursuing dog. The man was surprised, for he felt
that only his wife would have given &#8220;Watch&#8221; that light,
and the surprise was pleasant to him.</p>

<p>Then he unharnessed, watered, fed and bedded down
the weary horses, eagerly assisted by &#8220;Watch,&#8221; who
seemed to be in absolutely puppyish high spirits. Why,
even when he had with such frantic violence declared the
presence of a burglar in the far corner where the harness
hung and Mr. Tyler was compelled to pull down
and show to him the old blanket he was mistaking for
a burglar (a thing he had never seen in his life and
only heard of from a city dog following his master&#8217;s
buggy the summer before)&mdash;even then he was neither
humiliated nor cast down, but had, as was his wont,
slid into the stall of gray &#8220;Billy&#8221; (the oldest and best
horse on the place), and, standing up by the manger,
proceeded, with both paws, to dig for some sort of small
game in &#8220;Billy&#8217;s&#8221; shoulder. Then the horse laid back
his ears, opened his mouth and bit at &#8220;Watch,&#8221; who bit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
back at him&mdash;their teeth sometimes clicking sharply
together, to their seeming great delight. And this
continued until the low whistle of the man separated
the friends and play-fellows, and master and dog went
to the house together, leaving the closed stable filled
with humble rustic music, the rhythmic, melodious
expression of utter content, of comfort won, that is produced
by the crunch&mdash;crunch&mdash;crunch of great, white
teeth grinding silvery-yellow oats or crushing the
brittle sweetness of the orange-colored corn. Listen!
Count! One, two, three, crunch&mdash;crunch&mdash;crunch, now
a long, deep, soft sigh, then crunch&mdash;crunch&mdash;crunch!</p>

<p>At the house John met another surprise. He had
expected to hunt about in semi-darkness for the bread-crock
and the butter or molasses, or anything almost,
and take a &#8220;cold bite,&#8221; and go to bed, but here was as
good a supper ready for him as the limited contents of
their very primitive larder would allow, and oh!&mdash;crowning
grace of an American farmer&#8217;s meal&mdash;it
was hot!</p>

<p>Only pork, white, firm, sweet as a nut, crisply and
amiably sharing the same small frying pan with the
sliced potatoes! Hot &#8220;corn-dodger&#8221; and hotter coffee!
But oh, beyond these comforts there was a look in the
wife&#8217;s hazel eyes, a clear, bright, straight look that
shook his very heart&mdash;it was so like the good days of
the past!</p>

<p>When supper was over, and &#8220;Watch&#8221; was carefully
separating his bits of corn-bread with gravy on them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
from those bits which had none, and after the manner
of his race, eating the best portions first, Mrs. Tyler
came to her husband and put one arm about his neck,
while with the other she closely cuddled the baby to
her side. As John stood looking down on them, he
felt it was for him a blessed sight, and bent to kiss
her; but she avoided the caress, and hiding her face on
his breast, she made a full confession.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was as well that she could not see the
pallor of his face as she told of the hours the baby lay
abandoned in the woods, nor the drops of perspiration
on his brow as she described the bear in the
thicket and old, black &#8220;Watch&#8217;s&#8221; furious defence
of the helpless little one. The silence that followed
her plea for forgiveness was for a few moments broken
only by &#8220;Watch.&#8221; He had sat bolt upright before
them, watching their faces closely with his honest, brown
eyes, and now he sniffed and snuffled, as though on the
verge of tears, while with persuasive tail he rapped on
the bare floor so loudly that one might have mistaken
the noise for the nailing down of a carpet.</p>

<p>John raised his big, rough hand and smoothed his
wife&#8217;s hair. The clumsy strokes were given the wrong
way, and each one pulled harder and tangled worse,
until her brown locks were full of what the children
would have called &#8220;rats&#8217; nests.&#8221; But the awkward caress
was sweet to her, as precious as it was rare. Then he
said slowly: &#8220;Never do it again, Betsey! No! no! I
don&#8217;t mean that! I mean never worry all alone again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
If you are anxious and troubled about the farm, money,
or anything else, for God&#8217;s sake, tell me all about it, and
let me share the worry!&#8221; and he kissed her, and then
looking down on &#8220;Watch,&#8221; he said, gently: &#8220;Thank
you, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then I think he did a curious thing, for you
must remember &#8220;Watch&#8221; was simply a farm dog who
had never been taught one single trick in all his life.
Yet now, when he thanked him, John Tyler offered him
his hand. &#8220;Watch,&#8221; embarrassed and confused, lifted
and lowered his good ear rapidly, glanced at the hand,
then at his master&#8217;s face, half-lifted his left foot,
dropped it again, and suddenly raising his right, laid
the black paw firmly in the extended hand, and gravely,
unsmilingly, John Tyler held it a moment and repeated:
&#8220;Thank you, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the wooden bar was across the
door, the candle was extinguished, and darkness, silence
and peace descended upon the little, back-wood home.</p>

<p>When I, the writer was a little girl, a very, very old
lady used on bright, fair days to lead me down the
country road, past many white houses amid their
orchards, and point out a great, old hickory tree, and
tell me that was the spot where she had, in her madness,
left her baby, &#8220;who is now Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; she
would say.</p>

<p>But I always had to hear over again about &#8220;Watch,&#8221;
whom, the old lady said, &#8220;had scratched and fit, and
killed &#8217;chucks and snakes, and taken the children to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
and from school for eight years after that! And then,
one night, he had got up from his mat and come
into the bed-room and stood by the bed, and had licked
the hand of his master, and had gone back to his mat,
and in the morning he was quite dead. Just as if
Death knew he could only get him away from us by
taking him in his sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>And I would lean against the kind, old lady, and say
gravely: &#8220;What a pity he had to die before I was
born&mdash;I would have loved &#8216;Watch&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>And I love his memory to-day&mdash;brave, old, black
&#8220;Watch&#8221;!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Dinah</h2>
</div>


<p>Dinah was not &#8220;all things to all men,&#8221; but she was
everything to one small girl, and a good many things
to other members of the family. I think I had better
say a few words right here about the aforesaid small
girl. She was an only child, and so far beyond mere
prettiness as to be really beautiful. Quick, clever, and
high spirited, the slavish idolatry of her mother had
worked her ruin. <i>Enfant terrible</i>, she was a burden
to herself, a terror to all those about her; except during
the rare absence of that mother, when, oh! the pity, the
shame of it! the little Marie became obedient, gracious,
and charming; as sweetly angelic as she was beautiful.</p>

<p>To the friends of the family she was generally known
as &#8220;Tyler&#8217;s vixen,&#8221; &#8220;Tyler&#8217;s malicious imp,&#8221; or that
&#8220;pretty little devil of Tyler&#8217;s,&#8221; which seems to throw
considerable light upon her every-day manners and
behavior. Now, it&#8217;s almost needless to say that this
child&#8217;s path through life had been simply clogged with
toys, foreign and domestic, elaborate and simple, with
a strong leaning toward the most expensive in the
market. Even from that early period when she had
but two desires on earth, one to drink long and deep at
nature&#8217;s fountain, and the other to sleep profoundly,
they had forced her to keep awake long enough to
choose between a rattle of solid silver, with which she
could easily have broken her own wee head, or one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
gold and silver and coral; and her anger being great,
she rejected both, and clutched at a soft rubber affair
with a ring handle, offered by the nurse and positively
declined by the mother as too awfully common. And
it was at that point I made the small Marie&#8217;s acquaintance,
being led in to look at a baby that was so wise
that it had selected a ring-handle rattle, because it knew
it would be cutting teeth by and by and would need the
ring; at least that&#8217;s what the nurse said. One can
imagine, then, what a veritable army of dolls must have
fallen to the share of this so cruelly spoiled child.
Creatures whose waxen beauty almost broke the hearts
of less favored lookers-on; wardrobes complete and
exquisitely perfect&mdash;packed in real for true trunks;
tiny sets of jewelry&mdash;toilet-sets&mdash;parasols&mdash;fans&mdash;charming
carriages for these gorgeous beings to ride
in; blond, brown, and black-haired dreams of bisque,
china, and wax beauty; families&mdash;yes, whole families
of tiny, Swiss dolls, China dolls&mdash;from one scant inch to
ten in height! It was maddening, and Marie would, as
a wee tot, push away the great, prize doll, so heavy for
her little arms, and bury her weary face in the pillow and
whimper for&mdash;she knew not what! Poor, little, <i>blas&eacute;</i> baby!
Always deprived of the keen delight of wishing for a
thing, of the hope and fear in waiting, of the thrill of
seeing possibility become probability, and then the rapture of
possession!</p>

<p>One day this happened in the presence of a woman,
a sempstress, who was sitting by at work. She was poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
in pocket, but rich in knowledge of life, and kind of
heart, and she cried: &#8220;Oh, you poor, spoiled child! If
you had a nice, clean rag-doll, such as any work-woman&#8217;s
child may play with, you would, I warrant,
get more pleasure from it than from any of these big,
hard, silk-clothed ladies that you can&#8217;t baby or coddle
to save your life! I&#8217;ve a good mind&mdash;&#8221; then she paused,
but the weary, little face, turned from the splendid doll
in dull dislike, brought her to a determination; she went
on: &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to be quick, though, for her mother
would never give her consent, never!&#8221; So Marie was
put to sleep, and the sewing-woman left her proper
occupation and worked hard and fast on something else,
for this was the day of the creation of Dinah.</p>

<p>And I often ask myself this question: If that
woman of bright intelligence and good will, acting
under the influence of loving pity for an unhappy child,
could yet produce such a blood-chilling nightmare as
Dinah, what under the blue canopy of Heaven could
that same woman produce if her hand were directed by
hate or revenge? Nothing short of an eye-crossing,
world-convulsing creation, I&#8217;m sure! At all events, I
made a picture of Dinah, to show a friend of Mrs.
Tyler, and when she looked at it, she had a congestive
chill, and it was a good picture too.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t approve of written descriptions of
people, because they never describe. See descriptions
of lost people given to detectives, where height, weight,
and possible age are dwelt on with great particularity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
while a large, seedy wart, mounted conspicuously on
the bridge of his nose, or a drooping, partially paralyzed
lid of the right eye is never mentioned. Then again,
though Dinah was no beauty, I felt so much respect for
her powers of endurance, her silent patience under most
trying circumstances, that writing a personal description
of her becomes a painful task. However, if you
will go back to your earliest youth (a longish journey
for some of us, yes, but one still easily made), and
recall the paper-dolls of that period, dolls generally cut
from the white margin of the evening paper by the purloined
scissors of that member of the family who most
objected to your using them, you will remember those
dolls were always out in very wide paper pantalettes,
modest but ugly, chaste but very inartistic&mdash;well, if you
will, in your imagination, trim off the superfluous width
of those pantys, so as to make legs instead, you will
have before your mind&#8217;s eye an excellent ground plan
of Dinah&#8217;s structure.</p>

<p>The linen being doubled, and Dinah being all in one
piece, it followed that she had great strength of limb,
and never, even during the stress and strain of her
hardest years, did she lose either leg or arm. Yet,
whenever the spoiled Marie lost her temper, the bisque,
wax, and china beauties surely lost legs or arms or
eyes, Mrs. Tyler lost her head, and poor Mr. Tyler
parted with his hopes of heaven, while Dinah remained
whole and still in one piece. When her figure was
complete, she was about three hands high and without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
any sign of blood or race about her. One side of the
head having been selected for the back, because it had
puckered a little in the sewing, it was carefully but
lavishly inked, a plain solid coat of ink behind, while
about the brow and temples the ink formed those precise
scollops, gracefully termed by the French &#8220;water-waves.&#8221;
Then followed the eyebrows, still of ink, and
of fearful and wonderful drawing, and below them&mdash;eyes?&mdash;oh,
yes! eyes of course; what else could there
be beneath eyebrows but eyes? But they certainly
were peculiar eyes; there was no wearying monotony
about them, but rather a pleasing variety. One was, I
remember, quite nice and round, and looked to the
front in an honest, kindly way, while the other was
square enough to have corners, and it looked downward
and inward, right into that spot where, if she had had
any features, her nose would have been. As to the
mouth&mdash;I suppose I have to mention it&mdash;there was so
much of it, but I wish I could be silent; you see, the
linen was roughly woven, and here and there a coarse,
heavy thread appeared, and when the penful of red ink
was applied it touched a coarse thread, which soaked
up the ink like a sponge and led straight across her
entire countenance. Of course the red ink could not
be removed, and the situation and the mouth had to be
accepted, though it seemed the more remarkable
because of the infinitesimal mouths always given to the
dolls of commerce.</p>

<p>As to her taste in dress, only words of praise can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
given to Dinah. Never, never did I see her decked
out in silk, satin, or velvet, and only once, in the
middle of an oldest inhabitant&#8217;s coldest winter, did I
see her in merino.</p>

<p>She usually wore print or gingham, while her undergarments,
numerous and beautifully made, were of a
material so coarse and strong as to cause surprise to
strangers, but to those who had the misfortune to know
the little vixen, Marie, these coarse skirts, pantalettes
and chemises, stoutly stitched with about thirty-six
cotton, were luminous with meaning, suggesting as
they did the dread possibility of <i>tantrums</i> on the part
of said vixen, Marie.</p>

<p>Dinah was complete save for her shoes, which were
already cut from a pair of old kid gloves, and her name.
I remember her creator wished to call her Lillian, but
with all the wisdom of my five full-fledged years well
to the fore, I suggested that it would be well for all of
us to leave the christening to Miss Marie, herself. And
she of thirty-five years bent her head to my five, and
the name of Lillian floated back to the limbo from
which it had been so briefly called. As the second
shoe was taken up, Marie showed signs of waking, and
the newly created one was thrust into my hands, and I
was told to go and give it to the little tot. But deep
down in my soul I said, &#8220;Nay! Nay!&#8221; for mark you,
I was a canny child, and ten years of life&#8217;s experiences
had been crowded into my five of actual time, and hell
and bitter punishments took prominent places in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
religion thus far made known to me. I said to myself
therefore: &#8220;This child <i>is</i> wicked, for all she is so
pretty, she&#8217;s <i>awful</i>, and if for her punishment she
is to be frightened to death by the sight of this
nameless thing, I don&#8217;t intend to be the instrument
used in her undoing!&#8221; So, swiftly I crept to the
great crib-bed, and in a moment crept away again,
leaving across her stomach, like a hideous nightmare,
that &#8220;deed without a name,&#8221; and then I fled to the
hall and waited for things, behind the partly open door;
wondering which of the little cups and glasses on a
stand by the bed, holding cooling drinks, would strike
the door first. I waited and watched. Marie&#8217;s eyes
opened, a scowl instantly darkened her face; in a querulous
tone she asked, &#8220;Is my mamma, home, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice of the sempstress answered gently, &#8220;No,
dear,&#8221; and a light like sunshine came into her brilliant
eyes; she smiled sweetly and asked, &#8220;Where&#8217;s my
Cawie?&#8221; her name for me, and as near as she could
get to Carrie, and then she felt the weight across her,
and the moment had come!</p>

<p>She lifted the thing, and they were face to face.
The child&#8217;s eyes opened wider and wider, the pupils
dilated, the lids flickered nervously, then came a faint,
long-drawn &#8220;Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h!&#8221; another pause, broken at
last by the announcement, calmly and gravely made,
&#8220;She eyes, don&#8217;t fit each other!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie had trouble with her personal pronouns, as
well as with her relatives.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>Next moment she rolled over and began to scramble
into a sitting posture, during which she all unconsciously
pressed the doll tightly against her little chest.
(Oh, for us, happy accident!) for the next instant,
with a shout of surprise and joy, she cried, &#8220;Oh, she
cuddles, she cuddles!&#8221;</p>

<p>Two words which were to become familiar to every
member of the family, in the time to come, &#8220;She
cuddles, and she is Dinah, my peshous! Dinah,
always!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she who had thought of Lillian rashly
exclaimed, &#8220;But why on earth, Dinah?&#8221;</p>

<p>And received for answer, &#8220;Caus&#8217;, I say so, and
caus&#8217; my mamma jess hates the Dinah song.&#8221; A
so-called &#8220;comic,&#8221; named &#8220;Wilkins and Dinah&#8221; that
Mrs. Tyler raged at when her young brother used to
sing it within her hearing.</p>

<p>So it was pure malice that prompted &#8220;Tyler&#8217;s little
vixen&#8221; to name her new treasure &#8220;Dinah&#8221;! Then following
that rule of action familiar to all small girls
with dolls since before the building of the temple, she
turned Dinah upside down, that she might know
quantity, quality, and condition of her undergarments,
and when she found that Dinah possessed that final
charm, that very crown of happy dolldom, the ability
to have her clothes put on and off, to be dressed
and undressed at will, the measure was full, her joy
complete.</p>

<p>She turned her Dinah right side up again and kissed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
her fondly. At that sight my short legs basely
betrayed me, and I sat down with unnecessary emphasis
the deaf might have heard. Instantly the cry arose:
&#8220;You, Cawie, Cawie, come here and see my &#8216;peshous
Dinah&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>I rose and obeyed. Shortly after, when the
&#8220;peshous one&#8221; had been properly shod, and Marie was
dressed for tea, we went forth to walk Dinah; but
Marie, recalling the three handsome dolls sitting bolt
upright in the parlor, suddenly commanded me to return
and make faces at them, &#8220;real bad faces, too, for being
so stiff and big they couldn&#8217;t cuddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I suggested that she should wait till the gas was
burning, and then let the dolls see Dinah, and with
malicious joy she waited. And so began the fellowship
between those two. Straight into her warm and
tender, little heart the vixen took her &#8220;peshous
Dinah&#8221; and gave her a love that could not be shaken by
a mother&#8217;s angry tears, a father&#8217;s bribery, or the contemptuous
sneers of friends and neighbors&mdash;a love that
lasted so long as Dinah&#8217;s self. The effect she produced
on people at first sight was remarkable. There
was Mr. Tyler, for instance; a good-looking man, very
quiet, very gentle and very kind. He never drank,
yet the first time he saw Dinah he thought he did, and
he was afraid to kiss his wife, lest she should think so,
too; and I saw him secretly touch Dinah once or
twice, to make sure she was real.</p>

<p>Marie&#8217;s young uncle, too, he was preparing for college,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
and though he was gay and full of fun, his conduct
was excellent, and he was very strict about Sunday
observances, but when he met Dinah he exclaimed:
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be d&mdash;d!&#8221; Perhaps that was not Dinah&#8217;s
fault. He might have been thinking of his future
state, and had just arrived at that conclusion.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most disagreeable occurrence was when
the minister, Presbyterian, called, and not having his
glasses on, sat himself down heavily upon Dinah. He
instantly sprang up to remove the foreign substance he
felt beneath him, and meeting the malevolent eye of
the &#8220;peshous one,&#8221; he exclaimed, in a startled tone:
&#8220;God bless my soul!&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;I should say&mdash;what on
earth?&#8221;</p>

<p>But with a bound, the vixen, Marie, was at his side,
crying: &#8220;How dare you, you too fat, bad old man;
you sat on my Dinah and swor&#8217;d, you did!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a crimson face he answered: &#8220;Oh, no; oh,
no! my dear little child, you are mistaken. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Marie stamped her foot at him and cried: &#8220;You
swor&#8217;d! you swor&#8217;d!&#8221; upon which tableau entered
Mrs. Tyler.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, Dinah came to be accepted by
the family, and it was surprising to see how useful she
became to its various members. Mr. Tyler, who did a
good deal of office work at home, used her almost continuously
as a pen-wiper. Instead of having to pick
up a tiny round of cloth and carefully fit the pen to a
narrow fold, Dinah allowed a largeness and freedom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
movement very pleasant to him. Just a swipe at her
in almost any direction, and the pen was clean.</p>

<p>The young uncle, who delighted in the comfort of a
rocking-chair, yet detested its movement, used Dinah
as a sort of brake, placing her under the back of a
rocker at just the right angle to prevent action, while
many a time the somewhat flighty housemaid, having
forgotten to dust the &#8220;what-not&#8221; (indispensable
adjunct of the parlor of that date), would snatch up
Dinah and dust all the shelves and their contents with
her, fitting her arm or her leg into the depths of &#8220;To
a Good Girl,&#8221; or &#8220;From Chelsia,&#8221; or &#8220;Friendship&#8217;s
Offering&#8221;&mdash;these cups and mugs, with their roses and
posies and fine gold lettering, being veritable dust traps,
as were the sea shells, with the Lord&#8217;s Prayer cut on
their surface, and the parian-marble Rebeccas standing
by salt-cellar-like wells, and of such was the bric-a-brac
of that day, you know&mdash;the day of wax things under
glass shades.</p>

<p>The entire family used the back of Dinah&#8217;s head as
a pin cushion, while again and again I have seen her
act as an iron-holder, when a sash ribbon or bit of lace
had to be pressed just there in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>But it was as a weapon of defence that she got in
her really fine work. Grasped firmly by the legs and
directed by impassioned energy toward a wisely selected
point, Dinah was capable of giving a blow as surprising
to witness as it was stunning to feel. Practice
makes perfect, and so it came about that that vixen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Marie&#8217;s, aim was so quick, so steady and so true, that
she landed with Dinah right on the intended spot
every time. She paid no attention to rules about the
belt line, striking below it with as much vigor as above
it. There was never any clinching, because no one
would come near enough for that, but I have known
her to strike a blow with Dinah hard enough to rupture
Mrs. Tyler&#8217;s agreement with the cook.</p>

<p>Some months after Dinah&#8217;s arrival I became recognized
as a sort of family lightning-rod, since I had the
power of deflecting the fluid wrath and deviltry of
Marie&#8217;s temper and leading it to comparatively harmless
points.</p>

<p>She was very fond of me, partly because I was older
than she was, and partly because I found so many new
things for her to play. Everything I saw away from
home was served up at once as a play for Marie. Oh,
that was a great occasion when I saw a lady faint in a
store! Dinah had to faint so many times in one day
that she was wet clear through her whole body, from
her many revivings, and was in such a disgraceful condition
from the brandy we gave her that, being utterly
unable to stand, she had to hang on the clothes-line
several hours before she could be endured in a warm
room, and I remember Marie asked me if the lady had
smelled like that.</p>

<p>Mr. Tyler was not a very strong man, not sickly&mdash;what
a hateful word&mdash;but rather delicate; in fact,
though he never <i>said</i> so, he had nerves, and it must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
have tried them severely when he came to breakfast
and had to face Dinah, sitting in the middle of the
table, with her back against the big family castor, and
her one straight eye fixed upon his shrinking countenance.
The skeleton at the banquet never made half
the effect the &#8220;peshous &#8217;un&#8221; made, for in the first
place the skeleton was crowned with roses, and there
were bright lights and a small river of wine to help the
guests forget the presence of their ghastly companion;
but no skull that was ever bleached had a smile to
compare with Dinah&#8217;s, which crossed her entire face
and would have gone on and met at the back of her
head had it not been stopped by her side seams, where
her front and her back were sewed together. There
were no roses on Dinah and no wine to dim her effect,
and poor Mr. Tyler chipped his egg and crumbled his
roll, but, with that eye upon him, got no further, and
merely taking his coffee, he fled. The rest of us got a
side or back view, so we did not suffer so much. This
went on until dyspepsia developed. I have said before,
I was very fond of Mr. Tyler, and I began to look for
some way to help him. One day, at table, the uncle
had nearly betrayed a surprise that was being prepared
for the little Marie, and Mrs. Tyler reached out her
foot and pushed him to enforce silence, a movement at
once discovered by that acute young person, who thereupon
made a scene, and thereafter passed much of her
time, at meals, hanging head downward from her chair,
trying to see under the table that she might (in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
own language), &#8220;see who kicked who,&#8221; a habit which
caused many upsettings of things and much discomfort,
but one to which she clung until I made a suggestion
which found favor in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said I, &#8220;if Dinah belonged to me I&#8217;d make
her do something lovely!&#8221; &#8220;Oh, what?&#8221; cried the
little vixen, and after much coaxing I spoke, with the
blessed result that for over two weeks, at breakfast,
dinner and tea, Dinah, the dreadful, was carefully
placed <i>under</i> the table to watch &#8220;who kicked who.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried Marie, &#8220;yer can&#8217;t wink yer eyes at each
other, &#8217;cause I is looking at yer all! Yer can&#8217;t kick
each other, &#8217;cause Dinah&#8217;s looking at yer hard, and if
yer spell things, I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll just hold my breff and
die! so now, I&#8217;ll have to know everyfing!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mr. Tyler ate his egg and toast, and smilingly
drank a <i>second</i> cup of coffee mornings, and he patted
my shoulder and gave me a big, red Canadian penny,
which Marie, being jealous, took from me and threw
down the well, while the young uncle started the
lightning-rod idea, saying &#8220;that I had diverted Marie&#8217;s
deviltry from the top of the table to the bottom, where
it was harmless.&#8221;</p>

<p>I will mention one episode in Dinah&#8217;s life, and that
will serve to indicate pretty fairly what the others were
like. I always call it the hail-stone episode. Late
one afternoon a violent storm had come on. We were
all frightened, and poor, little, spoiled Marie was quivering
from head to foot with nervous terror. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
the rain turned to hail, great lumps of ice came dashing
against the windows, and &#8220;crack!&#8221; went a big window-pane,
and in fell the pieces of glass. Again came the
rushing rain, and the water falling on a table covered
with books, the housemaid caught up <i>something</i> and
thrust it into the opening in the broken window. Alas,
and alas! that &#8220;something&#8221; was Dinah! The
&#8220;peshous un&#8221;! Dinah the beloved! There she was,
her cross-eyes looking at us from between her glove-shod
feet, like a contortionist at a circus, while her
doubled body was thrust out into the hail and rain
outside. And there, all unknown to us, she remained
for a long, long time, and the thunder rolled and the
house shook till the spoons rattled and tinkled in their
holder. And suddenly Marie lifted up a marble-white,
little face, and putting out her hand to my mother,
said, faintly, &#8220;Aunty? (courtesy title only) tell God,
please stop! I&#8217;m frightened!&#8221;</p>

<p>The awful dazzle of lightning followed her words,
and again she buried her face, laying her tiny hands
over her ears, to keep out the terrifying sounds. A
lamp was lighted, and they began to undress her and
prepare her for bed, simply to divert her attention
from the storm. She was very silent, but she shook
violently, and her eyes were strained and wild-looking.
Suddenly the heavens seemed to flame! The crash
that followed left the ears ringing! We all cried out,
but the vixen gave a bound and stood in the middle of
the room; her eyes fairly blazed; she raised them to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
ceiling, and in a shrill voice she cried, &#8220;Stop! stop, I
tell you! I&#8217;m frightened!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again a dazzle of lightning, again a roar of thunder,
and in an instant that little bundle of nerves had
darted to the hall, and with both hands succeeded in
turning the knob (the wind did the rest), and to our
unutterable horror, we saw her little, white-robed figure
dart down the steps, and standing on the bit of rain-soaked
lawn, mad with rage, she lifted her challenging
face to the black sky, and stamping her bare, little
foot, she cried, against the wind, &#8220;How dare you, God?
I&#8217;m little Marie Tyler, and I told you I was afraid!
How dare you? a great big God like you, frighten a
little girl like me?&#8221; and then she was in her mother&#8217;s
arms, and was carried into the house dripping as from
a river, and spitting and hissing like an enraged cat.</p>

<p>The storm ceased at last, at least the <i>outer</i> storm;
there was another coming, for where was my &#8220;peshous
Dinah&#8221;?</p>

<p>Everyone looked, looked high and low, looked until
we got to the place, where we stood and looked stupidly
at one another, and then there came, in a strained whisper,
from Marie: &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>She pointed at a dripping bundle sticking in the
broken window-pane. Mrs. Tyler screamed outright!
Those cross-eyes looking at her from between those
stubby feet. There was a wild <i>abandon</i> in the attitude
that shocked her! But her scream was as nothing
compared to the succession of shrieks that broke from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
the throat of &#8220;Tyler&#8217;s pretty little devil&#8221;! &#8220;Who?
a&mdash;a&mdash;ah! Who? a&mdash;a&mdash;ah! Who? a&mdash;a&mdash;ah!&#8221; she
screamed after each &#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>At last she finished, &#8220;<i>Who</i> put my &#8216;peshous Dinah&#8217;
in that hole? She shall be killed, all dead! and put in
a hole, her own-self! She shall!! She shall!!!&#8221; She
caught up a glass from the table and dashed it on the
floor, breaking it in pieces. &#8220;Hurry! or I&#8217;ll break
everything, I will!!&#8221; And when Dinah was pulled out
and straightened, words of mine fail to describe her
appearance!</p>

<p>Marie held loving little arms out to receive the dripping
stop-gap, saying: &#8220;We&#8217;ll go to bed, right now,
my &#8216;peshous Dinah&#8217;! Never mind your nighty, you&#8217;ll
get cold! Come, and we&#8217;ll cuddle up, until you are all
dry again!&#8221; And then the storm broke! It was
simply impossible that Marie should be allowed to go
to bed with that dripping bundle pressed in her arms,
and it was equally impossible to make her obey or
listen to reason. It was a wretched scene. The mother
knelt to the child she had ruined, calling her, &#8220;her
angel, her star, her flower,&#8221; and Marie gave her a kick
or a push at each word, and swore oaths that a mule-driver
would hesitate before ejecting in a row. Where
had she learned them? Who knows? Who ever knows
how a beloved child learns evil? But on and on went
this battle, until at last, worn out with the past fright
and the present rage, the little vixen fainted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler sent for the doctor, and while waiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
his coming, and after Marie&#8217;s recovery of consciousness,
she said to me: &#8220;Carrie, can&#8217;t you think of some way
to keep that awful doll away from my darling to-night?
Try, child, try!&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought hard enough to turn my hair gray, it
seemed to me, before I was gladdened by an idea. I
went to the door and beckoned Mrs. Tyler, and asked
her, in a whisper, two or three questions about an article
she had been reading aloud when the storm arose&mdash;an
article about the water-cure, then the very newest fad.
She gave me the desired information, and thus armed,
I stole to Marie&#8217;s side, and with great seeming secrecy,
told her I had a lovely new play, if only her mother
would allow us (poor Mrs. Tyler!) to play it.</p>

<p>Rather languidly, she answered: &#8220;To-morrow,
Cawie!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I said: &#8220;To-morrow would be too late, because
Dinah had to be awful wet to play this game.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once she was all eagerness, and commanded me
to explain. And so it came about, that the &#8220;peshous
un&#8221; was stripped under loving eyes and rolled in a wet
dinner-napkin, and then &#8220;packed&#8221; in wet sheets, all
according to &#8220;Hoyle,&#8221; or the water-cure doctors. And
I engaged to give her several drinks of water during
the night, and assured Marie that she would find her
&#8220;peshous Dinah&#8221; all right in the morning, and Marie
laughed and talked, while I did the packing. And the
doctor found her with a high pulse and red cheeks, but
the wet doll was not in her arms. She refused to show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
her tongue, because she said the last time she put out
her tongue at him, he was mad about it, which was very
true.</p>

<p>He gave her a powder, she went to sleep, and the
rest of us humbly thanked our Creator.</p>

<p>Dinah was snatched out of her &#8220;pack&#8221; and put in
the warm oven to dry, while the other members of the
family slept the sleep of the weary and the worn.</p>

<p>Three entire years passed in alternate peace and
strife. Acting in the interest of decency and cleanliness,
Mrs. Tyler had covered Dinah with fresh linen
several times. Little Marie had grown taller, more
beautiful, and more impish; while Dinah still reigned
supreme, though almost every bureau in the house had
in its bottom drawer a wax doll or two, rolled up in
towels.</p>

<p>For some time before the great disaster, we had been
tormented by cats. Why our garden should have been
selected for their mass-meetings, I can&#8217;t imagine. We
lived in a fashionable quarter; there was an air of
eternal Sabbath brooding over our heavily shaded
street; a few lap-dogs resided thereon, but no one
stooped to cats. Yet night and cats descended upon us
together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler raised many herbs for kitchen use, but
after the arrival of the cats the herbs entered the
kitchen no more. The back garden was destroyed.</p>

<p>They were a musical as well as warlike race, and
their head notes, chest notes, and stomach notes, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
poured forth with passionate ardor, but I never, never
learned to distinguish the tenderest love song from the
wail of complete despair, though I was quick to recognize
the gage of battle. I also learned that the bitterness
and ferocity of an engagement was not to be
measured so surely by the loss of blood as by the loss
of fur.</p>

<p>But let me stop right here, and not weary the reader
with what I know about cats&mdash;tribal, nomadic, domestic;
their habits, laws, and superstitions; their sign-language,
being the very same that was taught to the
tail-chasing, sacred kittens of Cheops and the first
Pharaoh&mdash;and only state that in the study of feline folklore,
I have known of a student becoming so absorbed
that he forgot everything on earth, even the &#8220;lore,&#8221; in
his mad pursuit of a feline.</p>

<p>Now, one evening, Mr. Tyler brought home an old
friend, whom he asked to dine and pass the night. The
old friend had with him a small dog, who also dined
and passed the night. The gentleman was a bachelor
then, and if he is alive and sane, I have the biggest and
ugliest silver dollar in the world to bet against a crooked
hair-pin, that he is a bachelor now. The dog was small,
and it had hair&mdash;lots of hair&mdash;and judging by sight
alone, that was all he had. His master claimed that
he could see a difference between fore and aft, between
head and tail. Well, perhaps he could when the dog
was awake, but &#8217;twas base boasting to make any such
claim when he was sleeping. He was named &#8220;Bolivar,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
not after the military gentleman, but in memory of his
youthful and almost fatal attempt to swallow whole
one of those very large, hard, round candies boys call
&#8220;Bolivars.&#8221;</p>

<p>This four-legged guest had made that thing adored
of men, &#8220;a record,&#8221; and it was for killing rats. Now
you show me a dog with a record for killing rats, and
I&#8217;ll show you a dog who has broken the record killing
cats. It&#8217;s perfectly natural; he has to kill the cats or
there would not be rats enough to make a record with.</p>

<p>Bolivar was graciously received by Marie, who knew
but little of dogs, and who asked &#8220;why he bit his own
back when everybody&#8217;s legs were in his reach,&#8221; adding,
&#8220;If I was a dog I&#8217;d bite somebody else every
time;&#8221; which was pure and unadulterated truth, I&#8217;m
sure.</p>

<p>In the forenoon of that day, &#8220;Tyler&#8217;s pretty devil&#8221;
had favored us with one of her wildest tantrums. The
servant, Norah, had spilled a little hot tea over Dinah&#8217;s
foot, and Marie had gone into a very frenzy of rage.
Seizing Dinah by the legs, she had thrashed the girl
out of the room and the house; had with one sweep of
Dinah&#8217;s body cleared a small table of every article it
held; had cut her own hand; had held her breath
until she was blue; had indeed furnished her whole
family with healthy but rather unpleasant exercise for
both mind and body, and when she had so stirred her
monkeys up that we each chattered our teeth while we
swang madly from our own particular pole, she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
suddenly calmed down and requested me to bandage
Dinah&#8217;s scalded foot, and proceed with her to the
garden, there to play &#8220;sick lady in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>By some chance there had sprung up, at the very
foot of the garden, a large weed, a most uncommon
growth amid such surroundings; a great, big, coarse-leafed,
pinkish-topped thing, a sort of pretty tramp
from the woods or fields; I think it&#8217;s called milk-weed,
though to Dinah it was usually an orange orchard,
while only occasionally it became a pine forest in which
we lost ourselves and endured great hardships.</p>

<p>I remember it was an orange orchard that day, and
after a long play, when Marie was called to dress for
dinner, she advised Dinah to remain where she was,
saying, &#8220;When dinner is over I&#8217;ll bring you some
dessert.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I gave Dinah a book to read, and we left her.
We both looked back, Marie many times, and always
kissing her hand. And so I most often see her in my
memory, the &#8220;peshous one,&#8221; I mean, sitting stiffly
against the trunk of her orange tree, one foot bandaged
(without the formality of first removing her boot),
an open almanac on her lap, whose piteous, gray, old
jokes were to entertain her during our absence, her
water-waves trim and neat, her round eye mild and
pleasant, her smile almost meeting behind&mdash;so I saw
her that last day.</p>

<p>The dinner was over; it had not been what you
might call an hilarious affair. There seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
something in the blood of wives at enmity with <i>uninvited</i>
guests, and Mrs. Tyler was cold as ice and as
bitter as a black frost.</p>

<p>When dinner was nearly ready, Bolivar sneaked out
to the kitchen, where the cook had given him a large,
square meal, feeding him from her own hand, as she
told me afterward in confidence, until &#8220;he was that
full his eyes bulged, Miss!&#8221; And in that dreadful
state he waddled back to the dining-room, and when
dinner was over, sat on end by his master and laid
beseeching, hypocritical paws on his knee, and was fed
again, after which he was in a condition bordering on
apoplexy, and quite unfit to play &#8220;soldier,&#8221; or &#8220;dead-dog,&#8221;
or do anything in fact, save retire to the flyless
shadows under the piano and there sleep, audibly.
Marie was so interested in Bolivar and so busy flirting
with his master (she was a coquette at one year), that
she actually forgot Dinah, who still sat in the orange
orchard.</p>

<p>The bare idea of a dog sleeping in her house filled
Mrs. Tyler with such indignation that other arrangements
had to be hastily made for Bolivar&#8217;s accommodation.</p>

<p>Some former tenants had left a kennel behind them.
It was brought from the wood-house, a bit of old carpet
put into it, and the sleepy Bolivar was hitched to it
with a piece of cord. After two or three strangling
efforts to follow his master, kennel and all, into the
house, he finally settled himself, and we all separated
for the night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>We were all asleep&mdash;and then we were all awake
again! No, it was not the &#8220;crack of doom&#8221; we heard,
but if you were to break one boiler factory into a
foundling asylum and beat them together, you might
get an idea of the kind of noise that aroused us. I
murmured &#8220;Cats,&#8221; and tried to slip back into the
sweet land of &#8220;Nod,&#8221; but there came a new noise. It
had a wooden sound. What was it? My mother said
&#8220;Is the wood-pile falling down?&#8221; But it sounded to
me as though the shed was jumping up and down.
Suddenly we gasped, &#8220;The dog! The kennel!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next instant the cord broke and with an ear piercing
&#8220;ky&mdash;i, ky&mdash;i!&#8221; Bolivar set out to build up
another record. It was fearful! The carnage was
great, but the noise was maddening. Our nearest
neighbor came to his window and made very, <i>very</i> personal
remarks about people who would keep a dog
where they knew cats came. This gentleman&#8217;s head
was like a large, china egg, for baldness, and I think
the extreme hairiness of Bolivar added bitterness to
his words.</p>

<p>Had Bolivar been satisfied to kill his cats once only,
his record would have been bigger, but he had a habit
of killing his victims several times, going back to them
and shaking and tossing them and crunching their
spines with his front teeth, and while this habit had
the advantage of making his cats and rats very dead
indeed, it lost him a good deal of time.</p>

<p>I slipped out of bed and went to the window and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
looked out, just as the triumphant Bolivar tore around
the house, dragging his prey and kicking up the grave
as he ran. Just beneath me he paused to re-kill his
victim, shaking it viciously, tossing it over his head,
and with a goatlike spring catching it again. Then,
taking it at the head, he, with savage growls, began
nipping it down its back. At that moment I heard
the stairs creak, and some one softly opened the front
door, and then Mr. Tyler&#8217;s friend came into view.</p>

<p>He was dressed, or&mdash;that is to say&mdash;er&mdash;er, well, he
wasn&#8217;t undressed, quite. His feet were thrust into a
pair of heelless slippers, and I experienced a feeling of
some surprise at the number of strings I could see
dangling from him. There were two broad, white ones
hanging down behind from the waist-line, and at least
four pieces of white tape trailed along behind his bare
heels, which looked in the moonlight like a pair of fine
onions&mdash;moonlight always has that strange, transforming
power.</p>

<p>Yes, though his dress was careless and simple to a
degree, still it answered quite nicely for two o&#8217;clock in
the morning, though ten hours later it would have
landed him in the fine, new insane asylum waiting for
gentlemen dressed that way.</p>

<p>He conversed with Bolivar a few moments, and his
gestures, while a trifle angular, were really very
impressive and expressive. What he said seemed to
fill Bolivar with utter amazement, and finally with shame
and vexation. I am positive that, had he had a tail, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
would have been but a wagless sagging down, and
vanity of vanities. As it was, he could only bow his
head and meekly follow his master, carefully stepping
on all four of the trailing tapes, whenever he could,
and making a snap now and then at the broad, white
things dangling from the waist-line.</p>

<p>Once more was he put into the kennel and tied, this
time with a clothes-line, which might have tried the
strength of the best steer in the cattle market. Once
more peace descended upon us. Bolivar had earned
fresh laurels to rest upon. The live cats had gone
away, and the dead cats kept perfectly quiet, which
was all one had the right to expect of them.</p>

<p>It was yet very early morning when I heard Norah
at Mrs. Tyler&#8217;s door, knocking, and crying in a tearful
voice for her to &#8220;get up fur huvvens sake!&#8221;</p>

<p>She also called upon such a very large number of
Saints to come to her help that I am sure the house
could not have held them had they laid aside their
symbols and things and answered to her call. I suppose
they felt that everybody&#8217;s business was nobody&#8217;s
business, so none of them responded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler was unmistakably vexed as she opened
the door, and Norah was unmistakably startled, for
Mrs. Tyler not only kept her teeth in a cup of water
over night, but, to make it wave, she plaited her front
hair in many, many tight, little braids (that was before
crimping-pins), which looked like nothing so much as
a bunch of nicely cleaned and neatly tied rats&#8217; tails.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>&#8220;What is the meaning of all this to-do?&#8221; asked the
lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mu&#8217;m, its all that divil&#8217;s own dog&#8217;s doin&#8217;s!
Him that I fed with me own two hands, last night, till
his shape was gone intirely! And now she&#8217;s tored to
pieces! The Saints be good to us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; cried Mrs. Tyler, &#8220;what you are
saying!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do the same!&#8221; replied Norah. &#8220;I&#8217;m a&#8217;saying
that that dog &#8216;Bullinger&#8217; has tored her to pieces, and
she&#8217;s as dead as any mack&#8217;rel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is dead, Norah?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Dinah, poor thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; Mrs. Tyler stepped outside and quickly
closed the door behind her. She took Norah by the
wrist, gave her a shake, and asked in a low tone:
&#8220;What&#8217;s that about Dinah?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a burst of excited tears, Norah repeated:
&#8220;She&#8217;s dead, M&#8217;um, as dead as any of them nasty
cats down there! And I thought I&#8217;d come and tell
you, M&#8217;um, and if you please, M&#8217;um, before the young
lady finds it out, I&#8217;ll just be leavin&#8217; me place! No
M&#8217;um, you needn&#8217;t give me no character! I&#8217;ll just be
goin&#8217; peaceable-like, without any character at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>And long and earnest were Mrs. Tyler&#8217;s entreaties,
and many were the promises she made of protection
from the wrath to come, ere Norah could be induced
to light the kitchen fire, her first unwilling step toward
getting breakfast ready.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>Then, white and trembling, Mrs. Tyler called my
mother. They went forth and saw Norah had told
the truth. They returned and held a consultation.
Mrs. Tyler was for mad haste and another Dinah!
Mother was positive the deception could not be carried
out on such short notice, and a discovered attempt
would add fury to the storm.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Tyler insisted, and together the two
women worked wildly, in the hope of recreating Dinah.
With dripping brows and trembling fingers they were
fastening on her boots, when shrill and clear came the
cry of &#8220;Dinah! Where&#8217;s my peshous Dinah? I want
her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Truly we all wanted her at that moment!</p>

<p>I was scrambling into my clothes as fast as I could,
when through the open door I caught a glimpse of
little Marie; the next instant there was a cry of indignation,
followed by the words: &#8220;What&#8217;s that? What
ugly fool thing&#8217;s that&mdash;dressed up just like my Dinah?
Who&#8217;s been here already?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Tyler tremulously cooed that &#8220;No one
has been here, darling&mdash;it is not even time for breakfast
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie, with curled-up, contemptuous lips, held the
intended deceiver out at arm&#8217;s length and slowly and
derisively put out her spiteful, red tongue at her&mdash;then
suddenly caught her by the heels and hurled her
out of the window, remarking: &#8220;You nasty, little,
ugly beast! I hope the &#8217;hoppers and the ants&#8217;ll get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
all over you, and fleas in your stockin-legs, too! And
who ever brought you here shall be pinched, all black!
So there! Now, where&#8217;s Dinah?&#8221;</p>

<p>A pretended search followed, till suddenly Marie
remembered she had left Dinah out in the garden.
&#8220;Oh, Cawie! Cawie!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I forgotted her,
my own, peshous Dinah, and she&#8217;s been reading all
night, without her dinner! Oh, Dinah! Dinah!&#8221; and
away she started to the porch, on her way to rescue
her beloved. And then the old struggle, between
mother and child was renewed. In her foolish endeavor
to deceive Marie a little longer, Mrs. Tyler told falsehood
after falsehood. Now it was a curious thing about
the vixen, that she was utterly truthful, for her
mother was a prolific, though inconsequential liar&mdash;her
lies so utterly lacking cohesive power that they
never were known to sustain one another, and Marie
often berated her mother for her wrong-doing.</p>

<p>Now nearly distracted, the child suddenly turned to
me, asking: &#8220;Cawie, Cawie, has my Dinah fallen
down the well?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head, and answered, &#8220;No, Marie, dear,&#8221;
while in the same moment Mrs. Tyler quickly
exclaimed: &#8220;Yes, my sweet, she is in the well, but the
man will get her out, and to-morrow you shall have
her in all new things!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie glared at her a few seconds, then stamping
her foot, cried, &#8220;How dare you, you so wicked mamma!
Stop, now! Stop, I say; you make lies every day, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
do. Go do your hair up right, and sit in the parlor
and make lies, and let me find my dear Dinah. Cawie,
will help me!&#8221; and as she got through the door and
into the dew-wet garden, Mrs. Tyler cried out: &#8220;She&#8217;s
all right, she is in&mdash;in&mdash;the oven getting dry. You
can have her soon, only my angel, come and get
dressed now!&#8221;</p>

<p>But, with a cry of delight, her angel tore out of her
hands and darted into the kitchen, and before Mrs. Tyler
could signal, much less speak to Norah, Marie cried:
&#8220;Norah, what&#8217;s in the oven?&#8221; and that honest bond-maiden
answered, &#8220;Nothin&#8217;, Miss, its not hot enough
for biscuit, see!&#8221; and she threw open the door, and
into its black maw disappeared the child&#8217;s bright hopes.
She stood quite still, and looked first at one and then
at another. I was crying quietly, but I watched her
and saw her face growing paler and paler. At last she
took a fold of my mother&#8217;s dress in her hand and said:
&#8220;Auntie, is my Dinah dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she could lift her bent head to answer, Norah,
with a mighty roar, burst forth: &#8220;She is, Miss, she&#8217;s
dead and killed, and all tored up, and there&#8217;s nothing
left of her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor, little soul! Both hands clasped convulsively.
That curious quiver came to her eyelids, and the movement
in her slender throat showed that she swallowed
dryly at something&mdash;sorrow is always so hard to swallow!
Then she flung out her arms, and giving a cry
that pierced like a knife, she flung herself out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
the kitchen, and, of all, places in the house, made
straight for the dark store-room, off the dining-room;
she who feared but two things, lightning and utter
darkness, now sought the latter, and closed the door
behind her, where we heard her little hands feeling
for some catch or bolt to fasten it, but luckily, there
was none. Mrs. Tyler was nearly wild; the pantry
was very small, utterly dark, and nearly airless. In
it were kept barrels of flour and sugar, boxes of tea
and bags of coffee, and closed, it was black as night.
She prayed, pleaded, flattered, promised, and to each
prayer came a kick at the door, and the threat, &#8220;If
you touch the door, I&#8217;ll make me dead! I will! I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone stood helpless before this small child&#8217;s
power to harm herself. Mrs. Tyler denounced Norah
for telling. Other members of the family begged at
the door to speak to Marie a moment, just a moment,
in vain; yet her voice was distinctly weaker, and all were
frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must bring her out by force!&#8221; declared Mr.
Tyler.</p>

<p>And then, for the last time, I was called upon to
play &#8220;lightning-rod.&#8221; The uncle said, &#8220;Let Carrie try,&#8221;
and then all hands were on my shoulder, pushing me
forward, and before I knew it I was alone. I on one
side of the door, stupid and idealess, and Marie on
the other side, heartbroken and relentless. I was quite
a big girl then, but I&#8217;m afraid I had my finger in my
mouth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>I tried to think, but I didn&#8217;t; on the contrary, I
discovered a little nail-hole in the door that had been filled
up with putty, and then, faint and low, almost in a
whisper, I heard, &#8220;Oh, Cawie, Cawie! Oh, my
Dinah!&#8221;</p>

<p>And I sprang to the door, opened it, and went in,
and the next instant I was sitting on a bag of salt, and
poor Marie was across my knees, sobbing as though
her heart would break. I had left the door part way
open, and as I heard some one cautiously approaching,
I wildly waved my half-laced boots at them to keep
away. I had not said a word; I only sat smoothing
her silky, auburn hair, while she cried, and cried, and
cried, and every now and then gasped, &#8220;She&#8217;s gone,
all gone, every bit of her! Oh, my Dinah!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when she once added, &#8220;and I can&#8217;t do anything
for her in the world,&#8221; my idea at last arrived, hurried,
out of breath and belated, but still an idea, and I
eagerly said, &#8220;Oh, Marie, dear, there&#8217;s a little of her
left, enough to make a beautiful funeral!&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head, saying, &#8220;Got to have their
bodies to make funerals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;don&#8217;t you remember the poor
men your papa saw all blowed up by the engine?
There wasn&#8217;t much left of them, but they had funerals,
every one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her tear-wet face toward me, and asked,
dully, &#8220;How much was left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I replied, with an airy assumption of knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
worthy of my elders, &#8220;bits of skin, and little
bones like teeth, you know, and broken &#8216;spenders.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; objected Marie, &#8220;Dinah&#8217;s teef hadn&#8217;t <i>growed</i>
yet, and she didn&#8217;t <i>wear</i> spenders,&#8221; and her sobs broke
forth anew.</p>

<p>I reassured her by telling her there was quite a large
piece of Dinah&#8217;s flannel petticoat left, and over half of
her face (including all of her indestructible smile), and
perhaps we might find some more bits if we looked,
and we could put them all in a little, white sheet, in a
true box (a wooden box), and truly bury her just
like any other person.</p>

<p>The poor, little vixen sat up and put her hair from
her eyes and listened&mdash;she began to be interested&mdash;then
the tears slipping down her wan cheeks, she stole her
arm about my neck and whispered: &#8220;Cawie, where has
the <i>inside</i> Dinah gone?&mdash;the&mdash;the now-I-lay-me-down-to-sleep
Dinah?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was silent; and I could feel the trembling of her
body increase as she waited for an answer. Then she
wailed: &#8220;Oh, Cawie! tell me! tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor baby! who wanted her doll to be immortal
as herself! I dared not say she was in Heaven, so
without an idea of what Paradise meant, I calmly
told her that &#8220;Dinah was in dolls&#8217; Paradise&#8221;&mdash;and
that was the only time I ever knew her to be called
a doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Marie, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;it&#8217;s a lovely, clean, sweet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
place, where dead dolls wait till their owners get dead
too, and call for them on their way to Heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>May I be forgiven&mdash;but I certainly had a fine, able-bodied
imagination in my youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Marie, and she put her little lips to
mine and kissed me sweetly, &#8220;Oh, Cawie! I&#8217;se glad,
and I do hope she won&#8217;t get out and get lost&mdash;she gets
lost very easy, you know&mdash;before I get dead and go for
her,&#8221; and she took my hand and we came forth from
the store-closet, and at sunset, in a deal-box with brass
hinges and lock (from the young uncle), in a white,
silk handkerchief (from Papa), Dinah&#8217;s scrappy
remains were buried at the foot of the orange tree&mdash;buried
with flowers from every one, and passionate tears
from Marie, and many promises, as she kissed the box,
not to forget to stop at Paradise for her.</p>

<p>She had not allowed any &#8220;grown-ups&#8221; to do anything
except look on; she and I did all. The mother,
wishing to please her, said: &#8220;Should we move from
here, dear one, we will take up Dinah and keep her
with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Marie, with frowning brows, rejected this offer.
&#8220;No!&#8221; she said, &#8220;if her now-I-lay-me part got lost
out of Paradise, she could come right here and find her
old self in her home. If the box was moved, she would
be lost everywhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she went back alone, and I looked and saw her
pat the grave gently, and heard her say: &#8220;My peshous
Dinah!&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>The grave of all things hath its violet.</i>&#8221;</p>


<p>It was in mellow, many-hued October. It was a
Sunday&mdash;sunny and still. There was the <i>feel</i> of
Sunday in the air. Three years had passed since the
Great Soldier&#8217;s prayer, &#8220;Let us have peace!&#8221; had
been answered with bless&eacute;d acquiescence. But when,
for any reason, the people came together in a crowd,
it was sad to see how many still wore mourning. And
when the wearer was old or middle-aged, there was
something in the deadly composure of manner that
said as plain as words: &#8220;This will be my garb as long
as life shall last!&#8221;</p>

<p>One woman there was who watched with envious
eye those who passed her wearing &#8220;deep mourning.&#8221;
Envious, because she was herself denied the sad satisfaction
of this outward expression of her great grief.
Her husband&mdash;her dearer self&mdash;had simply abhorred
the custom&mdash;the &#8220;social bondage,&#8221; as he called it&mdash;of
mourning! The wrapping up of the strained and
shaken body in black garments, and then the shutting
out of every breath of pure air, every ray of God&#8217;s
sunlight with yards on yards of the most hideous
product of the manufacturing world&mdash;black <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i>&mdash;was,
he declared, detrimental to good health when worn
willingly, and when worn <i>unwillingly</i>, it was hypocrisy
as vulgar as it was cruel. And he had exacted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
a solemn promise from her, that in the approaching
hour of her loss, she would wear no <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i> at all, and
black only for the briefest possible time; a concession
made to save her from the wondering and satirical
comments of her friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>Now suddenly the church bells, the chimes, burst
forth and tossed high their ringing notes into the pellucid
air, sweet reminders to the Great-All Father that
His children, sinning, bewildered, yet loving, trusting
still, were gathering from afar to kneel and humbly
pray together; remembering well those words big with
promise: &#8220;When two or three are gathered together
in my name!&#8221;</p>

<p>And among the moving multitude, two women from
opposite sides of the city were approaching the same
church. Both were middle-aged, and both felt that, in
the better sense, their lives were over. Both were victims
of the war; both had lost their nearest and
dearest; and one, her home as well. And now, among
strangers, she wore her rusty <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i> with a dignified,
almost haughty carriage of body, which, nevertheless,
said plainly: &#8220;Here is the poverty which is so cruel to
the well-bred and refined!&#8221; She worked to eke out
her small pittance of an income, but there was no
sweetness, no savor in her work. She knew she was
growing hard and bitter in her sorrow and loneliness,
but what did it matter now; there was no dear one to
be wounded by her sarcastic speech. &#8220;A childless
widow!&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;why do I encumber the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
earth? There is no living thing that needs me, that is
glad of my coming,&#8221; and she shuddered in her thin,
black garments as she thought of the years that, dull
and cold, might be waiting her, and then saw the
church, and tried to bring her thoughts under control.</p>

<p>The other woman (she who sighed to wear black),
moving slowly and heavily, wondered why neither the
bright, warm sun nor the heavy, handsome camel&#8217;s-hair
shawl in which, to the surprise of her neighbors,
she was closely wrapped this warm day, could conquer
that little, creeping chill in her blood that every now
and then developed into a shiver. But she gave that
matter scant thought. Weary and dull to her, the
very bells seemed to ring out over and over again the
one word, &#8220;A-lone! A-lone!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had her comfortable, even handsome, home;
ample means to keep it up, but it was so empty!
There was no one to watch for, to dress for, to plan
for, cook for! No one to give her greeting, or loving
thanks for loving service. She was utterly alone, and
she was only forty-four, and might live&mdash;good God!
how long? If it were not unlawful so to do, she would
kneel here in the church she was entering and pray to
die at once, that she might fill her appointed place
between her husband and her son, and be at rest.</p>

<p>With such thoughts, these women approached the
church and each other. Foolish, wicked thoughts, you
say. Perhaps, but for a woman who is growing old,
whose heart is bleeding from many wounds, it is so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
hard a thing to face the great world alone. But so it
came about that as Mrs. Martha Swift, of Ohio, sat in
pew 71, an usher waved into pew 72 Mrs. Marion
Wallace, of Georgia, who was no sooner comfortably
seated than a quick shiver shaking the shoulders of
the woman in front of her drew her attention to the
shoulders and to the shawl about them. And then an
odd thing happened. Her glance, at first a merely
casual one, had quickly intensified into a prolonged
and piercing stare. Then she had raised her veil and
studied the shawl as if it had been the horoscope of
one she loved; studied it until from the seeming confusion
of the innumerable morsels of rich, dim colors
tossed together, there came order and a clear design.
Then, to the wonderment of two or three observers,
she drew off her glove and, leaning forward, passed her
bare forefinger eagerly along the edge of that bit of
solid color always found in the centre of these precious
shawls; did it carefully, as does a woman who
searches for some faint stain or mark, and suddenly
the blood rushed to her face; she drew back swiftly
into her place, resumed her glove, but from &#8220;Dearly
Beloved,&#8221; clear through to &#8220;Let Your Light so Shine,&#8221;
she never took her eyes from that shawl in front of
her.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Swift passed out of church, she thought
herself rather unnecessarily crowded by a tall woman
in black. She answered two or three friendly comments
on her bundled-up appearance by saying that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
&#8220;heavy shawl and all, she was still cold, at least part of
the time,&#8221; and, &#8220;yes, come to think of it, she was
shivering half her time yesterday&#8221;; &#8220;yes, it was a
lovely day,&#8221; and so slipped away as quickly as she
could, and started to walk across the Public Square,
that she might be alone; and then a woman in black
was at her side&mdash;a woman whose eyes were big and
bright with anger; whose trembling finger tapped her
on the arm, as she swiftly said: &#8220;Madam, this shawl is
not your property; it is mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Swift was so startled&mdash;so utterly taken aback&mdash;that
at first she could only stare at the stranger and
say, stupidly: &#8220;What&mdash;what did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the stranger, in increasing anger, repeated: &#8220;This
shawl is not your property&mdash;it is mine, I tell you! My
most precious treasure&mdash;<i>mine</i>&mdash;and I can prove it, too,
by marks you cannot gainsay!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Swift drew away from the tapping finger,
exclaiming: &#8220;Do you know who you are talking to?
You must be crazy! Why, I&#8217;ve owned this shawl these
five years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five years?&#8221; scornfully cried the other, &#8220;I owned
it long enough to know its full design&mdash;the dealer&#8217;s
private mark&mdash;that my boy showed me when he brought
it to me from his first trip abroad&mdash;and in the corner,
here on the under side, beneath a rough seam in the
border, you will find two letters worked in white silk&mdash;an
&#8216;M&#8217; and a &#8216;W,&#8217; and beneath them both a tiny
star in many-colored threads. See, then&mdash;&#8221; She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
caught swiftly at the corner of the shawl nearest her&mdash;turned
it back&mdash;scanned it closely, and then triumphantly
pointed out two small, imperfect letters in white
silk&mdash;&#8220;M&#8221; and &#8220;W,&#8221; with the star beneath, as she
had said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Swift felt her face flush, but she bravely
looked the excited woman in the face: &#8220;I do not understand,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;This shawl was a gift to me from my
only son!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A poor gift that&mdash;of ill-gotten property!&#8221; cried
the woman in black, and then Martha Swift lifted stern,
blue eyes and said: &#8220;Madam, my son was a soldier! He
lies out there, beneath his tombstone now! Do not insult
his memory!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she of the black, burning eyes said quickly: &#8220;My
son fell at the Bloody Angle&mdash;he was not identified&mdash;and
fills some corner of a trench that is marked, if marked
at all, by a stone bearing the cruel word, &#8216;Unknown!&#8217;
I insult the memory of no soldier, and I pray you pardon
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, all suddenly, they stood with working faces,
holding hard to one another&#8217;s hands, while their tears
ran swiftly. They were too deeply moved to speak much
then, and they drew down their veils that they might
not attract attention.</p>

<p>They had exchanged names and addresses, then
walked silently as far as the monument in the centre of
the Square. As they were about to separate, Mrs.
Swift said: &#8220;Mrs. Wallace, this dear shawl is yours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
beyond the shadow of a doubt&mdash;and back it goes to you,
be sure of that&mdash;but won&#8217;t you come to my house, in a
day or two, and tell me its story?&#8221; Then, seeing refusal
dawning on the other&#8217;s face, she quickly added, &#8220;I
would so like to hear about your boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah, subtle tempter! What mother could resist such
sweet flattery! Not this one, who for two long years
had not named aloud that beloved son&mdash;who entering
the army as an elegant young <i>beau</i>, had died in broken
shoes and tattered clothing&mdash;fighting like a demoniac!</p>

<p>Yes, she would come, and Mrs. Swift would tell her
side of the story too&mdash;would she not? And then it
would all come clear between them about the shawl&mdash;and
there would be blame to no one but herself, perhaps,
for her too hasty speech!</p>

<p>And with these promises they parted&mdash;each thinking
compassionately of the other: &#8220;How she must suffer,
it is so terrible a thing to lose husband and child too!&#8221;</p>

<p>The following Tuesday, on starting out to make the
promised visit, Mrs. Wallace became conscious of a
lightness, an alertness of movement&mdash;of a genuine
feeling of interest in the approaching interview, as
pleasant as unusual to her. And she wondered a little
that she felt in her heart no enmity for this Northern
woman who had, beyond a doubt, done her small best to
help conquer the South and destroy the beloved
&#8220;Cause&#8221;! But, considered simply as individuals, they
were both conquered&mdash;beaten&mdash;broken down forever!
In tastes, up-bringing and experience, they were as far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
apart as the poles, but between those two great cries of
motherhood&mdash;one wrung from the body&#8217;s anguish at the
man-child&#8217;s birth, and the other from the soul&#8217;s anguish
at his death&mdash;the women understood and sympathized
passionately with each other! With these thoughts in
her mind, Mrs. Wallace made her way to the pretty
house, with its bit of lawn, choice shrubs and late
flowers, that belonged to Mrs. Swift, and had the door,
after some delay, thrown open for her by an elderly and
very angry gentleman&mdash;evidently a doctor&mdash;who continued
an unequal contest with two hysterical and belligerent
maidens from the &#8220;Old Isle&#8221;&mdash;one of whom,
with the maddening iteration peculiar to her class,
repeated again and again: &#8220;&#8217;Twas meself that heard
it!&mdash;the Banshee! Bad &#8217;cess to yees&mdash;&#8217;twas meself that
heard it&mdash;the Banshee!&mdash;the Banshee!&#8221; while the
other, with maudlin tears, vowed she&#8217;d &#8220;lave that minute
for she couldn&#8217;t stand hearin&#8217; talkin&#8217; of blood and&mdash;shootin&#8217;
and such-like things&mdash;besides, when a woman
was crazy, she might kill the lot of them&mdash;and such
rucktions she couldn&#8217;t stand at all&mdash;at all! and lave she
must and would!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the doctor locked the door, put the key in his
pocket, and turning to the astonished looker-on, said:
&#8220;Let us get out of this hul-a-ba-loo! Come in here,
please, where we can escape from that infernal Banshee!
Now, Madam, Mrs. Swift is a very sick woman!&#8221; (&#8220;Oh,&#8221;
thought Mrs. Wallace, &#8220;here is the meaning of those
shiverings, last Sunday!&#8221;) &#8220;She is going to be worse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
before she&#8217;s better; she is absolutely alone save for
these rattle-brained servants, who were bad enough to
begin with, but are for leaving the poor soul here alone
because she has been a bit delirious. You look like a
sensible woman and a kind one. Are you an old friend,
and can you by chance help her and me now, in this
emergency?&#8221; Remember, you could not &#8220;push the
button&#8221; then, and let the trained nurse do the rest.
There was no button to push, and no trained nurse to
answer it. Each family had to care for its own sick.
To go to the hospital was looked upon as a degradation.
Such nurses as could be had were mostly poor, old,
homeless bodies, as ignorant as they were disobedient,
and Mrs. Swift&#8217;s case was not a very uncommon one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marion Wallace paused&mdash;before she answered.
She literally could not say, &#8220;I am a stranger.&#8221; At
her first slow words, &#8220;I am not an <i>old</i> friend,&#8221; such
a look of despair came into the doctor&#8217;s face that she
hurriedly added, &#8220;but still a friend, and&mdash;,&#8221; slowly
removing her bonnet and shawl, she stepped to the hall,
took the Banshee&#8217;s white apron from her, tied it about
her own waist, sent the Banshee herself upstairs for a
pair of slippers&mdash;&#8220;anyone&#8217;s would do&#8221;&mdash;and returning
to the parlor, said, quietly: &#8220;Now, Doctor, if you will
kindly give me your first instructions in writing, please.
You see, I shall have to get this demoralized household
set right again. When all is going smoothly, I shall
only need to be told your wishes, but just at first&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And the doctor had stared a moment, and then he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
had caught her hands and shook them half off, crying:
&#8220;You&#8217;ll stay&mdash;you&#8217;ll take charge here? You&#8217;re a
mighty fine woman, I can tell you that&mdash;and what I
call a good Christian, by&mdash;!&#8221; And so this strange,
Southern woman came to nurse faithfully her Northern
sister in sorrow&mdash;to guide her household into ways
of clocklike regularity, and so heard the story of the
shawl, not once, but many times&mdash;but always told with
fever-cracked lips&mdash;with burning eyes and hands wandering
and restless, and alas, always with hoarse entreaties
to believe her&mdash;her boy could not steal&mdash;no, not
even for her, his mother! He had bought the shawl
from one who swore he had come by it honestly! If
only the strange woman with the angry eyes would
believe her! &#8220;You see, it came about like this&#8221;&mdash;she
would say, and wearily begin all over again, to explain&mdash;to
convince&mdash;to defend!</p>

<p>Then one day the subject of her rambling talk was
changed. She seemed to be reading some account of a
Northern victory&mdash;over and over again, she repeated
all the details&mdash;the calmness of the great General&mdash;the
wild delight of the victorious troops!&mdash;the rags
and hunger of the prisoners&mdash;and always ended with:
&#8220;The enemy lost two thousand men killed and five
thousand wounded!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wallace had listened to the harassing repetition
of this Northern triumph until her strained nerves
could bear no more, and was turning with a flushed
face to leave the bedside, when a sort of gasping sob<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
stopped her. Once more the sick woman repeated:
&#8220;The enemy lost two thousand men killed&mdash;&#8221; and
then, in a tone lowered almost to a whisper, she added:
&#8220;Oh, the wives and the mothers!&mdash;two thousand killed!
Oh, dear God, be merciful to the poor mothers&mdash;the
heartbroken mothers of the South!&#8221; and Mrs. Wallace
sank upon her knees, and taking the burning hand of
the sick woman in her own, she cried: &#8220;Great heart!
I will love you all my life, for that gentle prayer!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words seemed to reach the inner consciousness
of the sufferer&mdash;her hot, blue eyes turned their glance
upon the calm, brown ones beside her, where they
wavered for a moment&mdash;steadied&mdash;rested, and then
recognition dawned in them, and a weak voice whispered:
&#8220;You said&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I loved you for your great heart!&#8221; answered
Mrs. Wallace.</p>

<p>A faint brightness came to the sick face, and she
said: &#8220;Then don&#8217;t leave me ever! We can love and
mourn our dead together! Life is so hard&mdash;to bear
alone&mdash;be my sister&mdash;Marion!&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked long into each other&#8217;s eyes. They must
have thought of many things! But it was as if the
hands of their dear, dead boys drew them together.
And Mrs. Wallace gently answered: &#8220;I will not leave
you while you want me, Martha! We will walk together,
if you will it, till we are called to join our dear ones;&#8221;
their hands met in a close clasp, and in ten minutes
Mrs. Swift was asleep. After Mrs. Swift had recovered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
the neighbors spent all their spare time, and a good
deal that was not spare, in wondering &#8220;when that
Southern woman was going away?&#8221;</p>

<p>Early in the winter they had seen two trunks and a
large picture brought to the house, but they watched in
vain for the exit of the aforesaid two trunks and picture.
What could it mean? They all declared Mrs. Swift
too active a woman to want a housekeeper&mdash;too strong
to need a nurse&mdash;too proud and too well off to have a
boarder! But surely she would have to go soon, now
that spring was almost upon them! And lo! one
sunny spring morning, both ladies, with garden hats
firmly tied on, and loose old gloves protecting their
hands, were out in the garden, making life a misery and
bewilderment to the harmless, nearly useless old gardener,
who, doddering about, accepted their orders with a
respectful misunderstanding of them that promised
rare developments for the future. One thing they did,
though, with their own hands. Mrs. Swift had obtained
a fine, young magnolia&mdash;a gift for Mrs. Wallace. It
was a pretty thought, and Mrs. Wallace accepted shrub
and thought with warm gratitude. And together, with
smiles, and may be a tear or two, they planted the
magnolia on the lawn, and at the same time filled the
souls of the neighbors with a very anguish of curiosity.</p>

<p>When summer came, notes from a well-played piano
floated from the open windows of Mrs. Swift&#8217;s house,
and no matter what classic composition Mrs. Wallace
might begin with, she always closed her playing with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
&#8220;In the Hazel Dell,&#8221; because that had been the favorite
song of the young Northern soldier, and his mother
loved to hear the simple, old air for his dear sake.</p>

<p>Winter came, and the two trunks and the picture
had not been removed. The neighbors had fallen into
a sort of torpor. Then, one day, one rushed to the
others, declaring: &#8220;They call each other by their first
names! Yes, Mrs. Swift said: &#8216;Marion, there must
be double windows for your room this winter!&#8217; and
that Southern woman answers up: &#8216;Oh, no, Martha,
that&#8217;s not necessary!&#8217; What do you think of that?&#8221;
Evidently there was no use in watching the house, after
that, for the departure of the Southern woman.</p>

<p>During the long winter evenings, this elderly couple
used to talk unceasingly of the war, and they would
tell one another of this or that engagement, illustrating
the positions of the troops with spools of thread, the
scissors always coming handy for streams that had to
be crossed. Then Mrs. Swift never tired of hearing
what the war had meant to the women of the South.
She wept over the burned houses, the looted property,
the hunger, the make-shift for clothing, and would draw
her rocker closer to Mrs. Wallace, as she told how the
last precious ounces of real coffee had been hidden&mdash;as
people hide gold or jewels&mdash;only to be brought forth in
tiny portions for a sick or wounded soldier&mdash;told how
she had cut up old garments of her husband&#8217;s to make
herself shoes, and had worn skirts made from her sitting-room
curtains!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>When spring came again, and Decoration Day
arrived, Mrs. Wallace felt that Mrs. Swift, for the first
time, showed a lack of tact&mdash;of proper feeling&mdash;in
insisting upon having her accompany her to the cemetery
that day. It would be very painful to see the
graves, all flower-covered, and to think of her own dear,
unhonored dead, lying so far away. This insistence
was so unlike Mrs. Swift&#8217;s usual manner, too! Well,
she must bear it! and so she entered the carriage, with
a heavy heart, to drive to the cemetery, and wondered
a little why Mrs. Swift had two great wreaths, instead
of one, to lay upon the grave.</p>

<p>When they arrived, she wished to remain in the carriage,
but again Mrs. Swift insisted upon having her
company, and together they made their way to the
family plot, and there stood the explanation of Mrs.
Swift&#8217;s strange conduct&mdash;a fair, white stone, bearing the
name of Wallace instead of Swift. And Mrs. Wallace
knelt humbly down to read that this monument was in
memory of the young captain, Marion Wallace, whose
body lay in the distant State where he had fallen fighting
for the &#8220;cause&#8221; he loved! As she pressed her
lips upon the name on the stone, she solemnly vowed
that the welfare of the woman who had done this thing
should be the one object of her life hereafter.</p>

<p>And so they faced the world together. A gentle pair,
helping the poor or the troubled; trusting and admiring
each other; Mrs. Swift honestly believing Mrs.
Wallace was the greatest pianist in the city, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
her feeble little sketches were remarkable works of art,
while Mrs. Wallace stood in speechless wonder at Mrs.
Swift&#8217;s ability, with only the help of an inch or two of
stubby pencil and a morsel of paper, to bring perfect
order out of the chaos of her accounts. And though
she had something less than three hundred a year, it
was really astonishing the muddle she could get her
affairs into! So it&#8217;s no wonder that she respected Mrs.
Swift as an mathematician of parts.</p>

<p>The shawl was worn by one as often as the other,
though it was acknowledged to be Mrs. Wallace&#8217;s property,
since she owned it for years before that day when
young Lieutenant Swift had purchased it from a soldier
who declared he had bought it for a few dollars from
an old contraband camp-follower. And as they shared
the shawl, so they shared everything&mdash;duties, pleasures,
or personal belongings. Each acted as housekeeper,
month about. If one was daintier, the other had more
executive ability. They came to understand each other
so perfectly that when Mrs. Wallace sometimes sat
completely lost in thought, Mrs. Swift could tell, from
the expression of her face, whether she was thinking of
her son&#8217;s young manhood and soldierly death or of his
baby days when within the tender circle of her arms
he found a very tower of defence against the world.</p>

<p>The last time I saw them they were in church&mdash;the
same church where they first saw each other. Two
sweet-faced, old women; one blue-eyed, one dark-eyed,
but both with whitened hair, each anxious to serve the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
other; Mrs. Swift a trifle quicker about wraps and
foot-stools, but Mrs. Wallace smilingly ahead in the
finding of places in hymnal or prayer book. As they
sat with attentive, uplifted faces, I thought they looked
like two ancient children who had walked hand in hand
over a long, rough road that <i>alone</i> either would have
shrunk from.</p>

<p>True sympathy had drawn all bitterness from their
grief, while their unshakable faith in the resurrection
of the body and the Life everlasting, had kept Hope
alive in their souls! Hope for that &#8220;Life of the world
to come&#8221;! And Hope&#8217;s sweetness was in their old eyes
and about their paled, tremulous lips, as they worshipped
there.</p>

<p>The last prayer said, each instinctively put out her
hand to assist the other to rise. Their hands met; so
did their eyes, and they smiled at each other, and at
that very moment the sunlight, striking on the stained-glass
window, flung a very halo of splendid color about
their dear, white heads, the church thus smiling upon
them as they smiled upon each other; and I said to
myself: &#8220;The Aftermath&mdash;truly they have garnered
their Life&#8217;s Aftermath!&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
